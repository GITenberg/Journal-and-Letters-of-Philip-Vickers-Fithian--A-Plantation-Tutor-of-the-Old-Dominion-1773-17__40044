<h2><i>Preface</i></h2>


<p>Once in a great while historians find a firsthand account that provides
striking insight into a past era. Only rarely is such a document
written with the perception and charm that make its readers feel
as if they had participated in the incidents described and shared
the experiences related. The journal and relevant correspondence of
Philip Fithian constitute this kind of source.</p>

<p>Fithian was reared in New Jersey and attended the College of
New Jersey in Princeton, receiving his degree in 1772. Before entering
the Presbyterian ministry, he followed the advice of President
Witherspoon of Princeton and became a tutor in the family of
Robert Carter at "Nomini Hall" plantation on the Northern Neck
of Virginia. The reactions of the somewhat austere young man to
the rich, warm life of a Virginia plantation are always instructive
and often amusing. The Carters and their seven children were a
fascinating family, liberal in their sentiments and deeply interested
in books and music. Fithian sets forth truthfully, yet with lively
touches, the family's assessments of the society in which it moved,
the institution of slavery, and the dispute developing with the
mother country. Throughout his experiences Fithian remained true
to his "fair Laura"&mdash;Elizabeth Beatty in far off New Jersey.</p>

<p>The journal, with certain of the letters, was first published in
1900, in somewhat abbreviated form, by the Princeton Historical
Association. Dr. Hunter Dickinson Farish, in his edition of <i>The
Journal and Letters of Philip Vickers Fithian</i> (Williamsburg Restoration
Historical Studies, III; Williamsburg, Va., 1943), included
the complete journal, added other relevant letters as well as Fithian's
catalogue of Carter's library, and supplied a thoughtful Introduction.</p>

<p>Dr. Farish was Director of Research at Colonial Williamsburg
from 1937 until ill health forced him to retire in 1944. He broadened
the program there by bringing young research associates to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
staff, making grants-in-aid to scholars in the field of early American
history, and establishing and editing the Williamsburg Restoration
Historical Series. He also taught at the College of William and
Mary and helped to work out the organizational plans for the Institute
of Early American History and Culture, which since 1943
has been jointly sponsored by Colonial Williamsburg and the College
of William and Mary.</p>

<p>Dr. Farish's edition of the <i>Journal</i> had been out of print for a few
years when, in 1957, Colonial Williamsburg reissued it, with pen
and ink illustrations by Fritz Kredel designed to interest new readers.
The present edition by the University Press of Virginia reproduces
the 1957 one, but in convenient paperback form. Young
Fithian's revealing picture of Virginia plantation life will always
be a key source for the historian and an absorbing human document
for the general reader.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER ONE</i></h2>

<h3>Virginia During The Golden Age</h3>


<p>In the "Golden Age," or half-century immediately preceding
the American Revolution, a remarkable civilization reached its
zenith in the broad coastal plain of eastern Virginia. Gradually,
during a century of colonization and expansion, the heavily wooded
tidewater had been converted into a land of settled order and accumulated
wealth. Vast estates had been carved out of the wilderness
and large plantations were everywhere the rule.</p>

<p>Embraced by numerous arms of the Chesapeake and covered by
a network of wide rivers and creeks, this sylvan Venice abounded in
safe and convenient water routes. Pressing through the mouths of
the deep estuaries, the ocean tides reached the "fall-line," beyond
which the streams were inaccessible to shipping owing to the rapids.
Ocean vessels could penetrate to the plantations in every part of the
lowlands and carry cargoes thence straight to the wharves of London
and the outports. Despite the distance and rigors of the voyage, the
colonists of the Tidewater had maintained a constant intercourse
with the mother country from the time of their earliest settlement.</p>

<p>The hope had long persisted that this coastal plain might yield the
ores, timber, ship stores and other products England needed, and
for which she then largely depended on foreign potentates. Lacking
an ample supply of cheap labor, however, colonial industries could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
not compete with well-established ones of the Old World. For well
over a century tobacco proved the one commodity which the colony
could profitably produce for the home market in large quantities.</p>

<p>A notable result of the method of tobacco cultivation was a rapid
depletion of the soil. Intent only upon reaping quick returns, men
customarily neglected the most ordinary precautions to preserve
fertility. Since the tobacco plant required the richest loam to produce
the leaf in its perfection, fields were usually abandoned after three
or more crops had been harvested, and "new grounds" were cleared.
Thus there developed an ever recurring need for fresh lands.</p>

<p>Under so wasteful a system, Virginians had soon realized the
necessity of acquiring many times the quantity of land they could
cultivate at any one time. Farseeing men, realizing a day would come
when fertile soil could no longer be had for a song, wished also to
provide sufficient elbow room for their children at a future day. The
appreciation in land values in a new country provided a further incentive
to the accumulation of large holdings. As a result, enterprising
persons everywhere competed to secure the best tracts.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the seventeenth century the practice of engrossing
lands gained increased momentum. African slavery was
rapidly superseding white indentured servitude as the principal source
of labor supply. The price of tobacco had steadily declined owing to
overproduction, the burdens of the Navigation Acts, and the effects
of European wars. As a result of these conditions, the margin of
profit from the leaf had so decreased that the cheaper labor of slaves
and large-scale production had now become virtually essential to
economic survival. After he had served his indentureship, the white
servant could no longer establish himself as an independent farmer
as he had once done, and the small yeoman now usually felt obliged
to sell his lands to his wealthier neighbor and either become his tenant
or migrate to some other section or colony. Political developments
likewise favored the accumulation of large estates. Through repeated
intermarriage certain families had acquired a very extensive influence.
Members of these families were active in the Governor's Council or
the House of Burgesses and held other high offices as a matter of
course. Their official position often aided them as private individuals
in acquiring lands. Through the presentation of "head right" certificates,
compensation for military services, purchase from private proprietors,
and other ways they obtained domains comprising thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of acres. Some carved out what resembled small principalities.
William Fitzhugh of Stafford County owned over 50,000 acres, and
by 1732 Robert or "King" Carter of Lancaster County held some
333,000 acres.</p>

<p>The estates of such men, far from consisting of one compact property,
generally comprised many separate and sometimes widely
scattered tracts, perhaps in half a dozen or more counties. They
ranged in size from a few hundred to thousands of acres. The individual
owner acquired his holdings over a period of years, in what
often appeared a haphazard manner. Not infrequently, a planter,
foreseeing the depletion of his Tidewater lands, engrossed large tracts
in the Piedmont and Valley sections.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Life in the Tidewater during the Golden Age was dominated, to a
remarkable extent, by families possessing vast estates. Not everyone,
it is true, owned such princely domains as the Carters or Fitzhughs,
but men in their station were imbued with a deep sense of their obligation
to society. They sat as justices in the county courts, served as
sheriffs and as colonels of the militia in their counties, and acted as
vestrymen and church wardens in their parishes. They accepted
seriously their duty to preserve the peace and watch over the less
fortunate classes. Because of their wealth and position, their education,
resourcefulness and keen sense of public responsibility, they
were able to influence and to impress their ideals and tastes upon the
community in a measure rarely equalled by a similar aristocracy.</p>

<p>The great landed proprietors operated their estates in either of
two ways or a combination of the two. They might take full responsibility
themselves, planting tobacco and secondary crops; they could
lease tracts to others to cultivate; or they might do both. Sometimes
a man leased more of his arable lands than he reserved for his own
use. Though disturbed conditions in Europe and the burdens imposed
by the British regulatory system led to repeated attempts to
develop other staples for export, tobacco continued to be the mainstay.
Aside from money crops, however, the great landowners had to
supply numerous foodstuffs and other commodities needed on their
plantations.</p>

<p>A proprietor customarily resided on what was generally known as
the "manor plantation."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This seat usually served as the nerve center
of the activities of his entire estate, with the other units subordinate
to it. Not infrequently some of the outlying properties were devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
to producing commodities needed by the manor plantation and by
such other plantations as were engaged in raising tobacco and other
marketable staples. Overseers or stewards managed the units over
which the owner found it difficult to exercise personal supervision.
These men reported to him at regular intervals to receive instructions
and give an account of their stewardship.</p>

<p>Though the basis of life was agricultural, the great landowners
discharged a wide variety of other economic functions. They served
as factors for their neighbors, buying their crops, selling them supplies,
and providing them with credit facilities. Many sent vessels
regularly up and down the Chesapeake and the Virginia rivers, purchasing
the produce of others for later marketing. In like fashion
they brought manufactured goods from overseas for sale in the plantation
stores. When European conditions interfered with the import
trade, enterprising men frequently set up grist mills, textile factories,
foundries, and other manufactories on their plantations, to supply
their own and their neighbors' needs.</p>

<p>The great Tidewater proprietors of the Golden Age were, then,
no perfumed courtiers spending their days in idleness and diversion
and consciously seeking to avoid all "taint of trade." In a very real
sense they were capitalists, acute men of business, seriously concerned
with managing their estates, tilling their lands and disposing of their
produce, and eager to reap a profit through trading with their neighbors.
Their ledgers and their correspondence reveal their energy,
shrewdness, and enterprise. In a similar way the constant stream of
letters they wrote the factors who served them in London, Bristol,
and other ports of the mother country show their vital interest in
conditions in the world market.</p>

<p>The planters' preoccupation with such matters does not signify
that they lacked grace of living, nor that they were deficient in
aristocratic ideals. They were determined they should not revert to
barbarism in the wilderness. At no time did they allow themselves to
forget that they were inheritors of British civilization.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Taking the
English gentry as their model, they tried, insofar as colonial conditions
would allow, to follow the ways of the country gentlemen of
the homeland. On that pattern they fashioned their manners, their
homes, their diversions; and with a similar aim they sought to acquire,
and instruct their sons in, every branch of knowledge useful to a
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>That it was a constant concern of these planter-businessmen to
see that their children should acquire "polite" accomplishments is
clearly revealed in their papers. In a letter in 1718 Nathaniel Burwell
of "Carter's Grove" deplored his son's inattention to his studies, not
only because an ignorance of arithmetic would hamper him in "the
management of his own affairs," but also because, lacking a broad
basis of knowledge, he would be "unfit for any gentleman's conversation
and therefore a scandalous person and a shame to his relations,
not having one single qualification to recommend him."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In a like
spirit William Fitzhugh of "Bedford" in Stafford County asserted in
1687 that his children had "better be never born than illbred."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Though a parent sometimes specified that his sons be taught languages,
philosophy, dancing, fencing, and other such "polite" subjects,
practical studies were not neglected. Such subjects as mathematics,
surveying, and law prepared a youth for managing the estate
he would one day inherit and for discharging the obligations to
society imposed by his position. The goal was not professional specialization,
but, rather, an education which would develop fully
every side of a gentleman's character. George Washington expressed
this ideal in referring to plans for the education of his ward, young
"Jacky" Custis, in 1771. Admitting that "a knowledge of books is
the basis upon which other knowledge is to be built," he explained
that he did not think "becoming a mere scholar is a desirable education
for a gentleman."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Thus, also, Robert Beverley, father of Harry
Beverley of "Hazelwood" in Caroline County, directed in his will
that his son's guardians should continue the boy's education until he
should be taught "everything necessary for a gentleman to learn."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Books provided a ready means of transmitting English standards
of life to the colony. The carefully selected volumes in the manor
houses clearly reveal their owners' aspiration to become "compleat
gentlemen." It was not unusual for the collection of a prosperous
planter to number as many as one or two thousand. Works providing
guidance in the mode of life they admired greatly predominated,
though works of literature were not absent. English "courtesy" and
"conduct" books were on every gentleman's shelves. Richard Allestree's
<i>A Gentleman's Calling</i> and Henry Peacham's <i>The Compleat
Gentleman</i>, and other works which portrayed fortitude, prudence,
temperance, justice, liberality, and courtesy as cardinal virtues appear
again and again in the inventories of the period, along with the writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
of Castiglione and other Italians of an earlier day from whom
English authors had derived ideas of courtly conduct.</p>

<p>Most numerous were works stressing a gentleman's religious obligations.
Duty to God and Church was set forth in devotional works
of various kinds, collections of sermons, and theological treatises.
Then came books on historical subjects which offered actual examples
of men of great deeds. There were also many volumes on politics
and statecraft and military manuals, all of them useful in teaching
the larger obligations which a man of wealth owed to society. Guidance
in the practical duties of a great estate was furnished in treatises
on various phases of farming and gardening, manuals of medicine and
surgery, books on surveying and engineering, commentaries on law
and legal procedure and handbooks of architecture.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Naturally, the character of the schooling provided for the growing
generation greatly concerned the Virginia gentlemen. Many, eager
to give their children direct contact with the traditional learning and
culture of the mother country, sent them for a period of years to
English schools.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Not infrequently, mere infants were placed under
the protection of relatives and friends in the mother country. As early
as 1683 William Byrd II, then nine years old, and his sister Susan,
about six, were being watched over in English schools by their Horsmanden
grandparents, and plans were making to send over their little
sister, Ursula, aged four. Each of the great "King" Carter's five boys
was sent overseas at an early age. In 1762 John Baylor of Caroline
County, who had received his own education at Putney Grammar
School and Caius College, Cambridge, sent his twelve-year-old son to
Putney, and about the same time put his four young daughters at a
boarding school at Croyden in Kent.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The high value placed upon schooling in England is well illustrated
in the attitude of Robert Beverley of "Blandfield" when he prepared
to send his young son, William, abroad in 1773. Confiding the lad for
a season to a tutor in the home of his father-in-law, Landon Carter of
"Sabine Hall," he carefully explained his purpose. "I would recommend
to Mr. Menzies the Latin Lillies Grammar," he wrote Carter,
"because, as no other rudiments are used in any Schools of Eminence,
when he goes to England, he may in part have gotten over the Drudgery
of Education. All I wish to learn him in Virginia is, to read, write,
&amp; cypher, &amp; do as much with his Grammar, as the Time will admit
of...."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Planters frequently provided in their wills that their young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
sons and daughters be educated abroad. It is likely that an even larger
number of small children would have been sent "home," as the planters
fondly called the mother country, had their parents not feared
the dangers of an ocean voyage and the mortal effects of the smallpox
which was raging in England during the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>As an alternative to sending children overseas, the traditional learning
of the English schools could be brought to Virginia by
English-trained tutors and governesses. Well-to-do planters customarily engaged
such persons to instruct their children at home, even when it
was planned to send the youngsters abroad later. They also employed
dancing and music masters to visit their households at regular intervals.
A building near the mansion was generally set aside as a schoolroom.
There the master's children and perhaps those of some neighboring
planters were taught. The young men and women who came
overseas to teach the children of Virginia were honored members of
the households in which they lived. Great care was taken in selecting
them. After a number of young Scotchmen had come to the colony
as tutors during the eighteenth century, it was feared they would
"teach the children the Scotch dialect which they can never wear
off."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Throughout the period one finds frequent mention of the need
of suitable instructors in the letters of the planters to their factors in the
mother country. After the middle of the century, tutors were sometimes
secured from Princeton and other American colleges.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>A goodly number of the youths sent to the English schools enrolled
later at the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, and others who
had been educated by private tutors were also sent there. Certain
families sent generation after generation of sons to these universities.
At intervals from the time that Ralph Wormeley, the second of that
name, had matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1665, until the
outbreak of the Revolution, his kinsmen were found in English colleges.
Not a few young Virginians attended the Inns of Court.</p>

<p>In his domestic establishment the planter sought to reproduce as
nearly as he conveniently could the residence of the English gentry
with its gardens, lawns, and parks. Plans of English homes and gardens,
which intelligent workmen or even a layman might adapt, were
accessible in the handbooks of architecture and gardening found in
many of the planters' libraries. In some instances the striking similarity
of detail leaves little doubt that the plans for a planter's residence
derived directly from plates in these books. All the forms common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
to the English country architecture of the period were employed in
the plantation residences. Sometimes English master builders and
gardeners were imported to supervise the construction of the residences
and the planting of the grounds.</p>

<p>The vogue for formality in English architecture and landscaping
was mirrored in the arrangement of the Virginia estates. The mansions
were generally placed according to carefully preconceived plans
in a formal setting which nonetheless managed to achieve an air of
ease and naturalness. Balance and symmetry were observed everywhere,
with the buildings, gardens, and extensive lawns forming component
parts of one composition. Walks of brick or oyster shell
crossed the grounds in geometric pattern. If a bowling green or formal
garden flanked one side of the mansion, an orangery or perhaps
a park stocked with deer flanked the other.</p>

<p>English box and other ornamental plants were used with fine effect.
Terraces, elaborate parterres, sunken panels, canals, and dramatic vistas
gave variety to the scene. "Falling gardens" were popular at the
residences situated on high eminences overlooking the great rivers
and marshes.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Not infrequently, as at "Blandfield," a ha-ha provided
a note of pleasant surprise for one walking on the lawns.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Graceful
garden houses, dovecots, and other miniature structures, carefully
placed, sometimes imparted a fanciful atmosphere to the whole.
Every estate had its orchard, the fruit of which surpassed the choicest
specimens of the homeland. Wildernesses or preserves of transplanted
trees might be found at some distance from the residence, and sometimes
serpentine drives and walks invited one to explore hidden
retreats.</p>

<p>Situated amidst such attractive surroundings, the residences appeared
to fine advantage. Their architectural arrangement contributed
much to their impressiveness. At the same time it was admirably
suited to the peculiar needs of plantation life. The mansion or "great
house" was but the central unit, about which, at carefully spaced
intervals, stood numerous smaller structures, all subsidiary to it.
Spoken of indiscriminately as "offices," these dependent buildings all
served some useful purpose or function in the domestic economy.</p>

<p>The mansion was usually a substantial two-story, rectangular building
of brick, though sometimes it was built of stone or wood. The
rather low-pitched roofs were generally shingled with cypress or
slate. Since many of the activities of the household were carried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
in offices under separate roofs, a central structure approximately
seventy-five feet long and forty-two feet wide was usually regarded
as commodious. The exteriors of these houses were often characterized
by an elegant simplicity achieved through perfection of line and
proportion. The severity of a facade might be relieved by a handsome
wooden cornice, a pedimented hood over the doorway, a string-course
and water table of molded brick, and window and door facings
of rubbed brick. Sometimes pilasters of finely molded brick
framed the doorways.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the principal offices, set in advance or in the rear
of the mansion, served as foils to impart greater dignity to it. Sometimes,
as at "Blandfield" and "Mount Airy," the major offices were
connected with the central building by straight or curved lateral
passages. The great house and its dependent structures were generally
placed in such a relation as to form one or more rectangular courts.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The principal offices were often large and contained a number of
rooms.</p>

<p>To one unfamiliar with plantation life, the number and diversity of
the offices about the manor house occasioned astonishment. A Huguenot
exile who visited "Rosegill," the home of Ralph Wormeley, as
early as 1686, recorded that the master's residence comprised at least
twenty structures. "When I reached his place," this Frenchman
wrote, "I thought I was entering a rather large village, but later on
was told that all of it belonged to him."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Offices near the great house were utilized as counting-rooms,
schoolrooms, and sleeping quarters for the sons of the family as well
as for a variety of other purposes. The kitchen, wash-house, dairy,
smoke-house, and other offices intimately connected with the processes
of housekeeping were usually set farther away in order to keep
the mansion cool in summer and free it of the noise and odors of
cooking.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Within the manor house the lower floors were usually devoted
entirely to social purposes. Halls and chambers were generally finely
panelled in native pine or walnut, and the symmetry of the paneling,
the deeply recessed windows, and the excellent proportion of the
doors and mantels imparted dignity and beauty to the rooms. Frequently
the effect was heightened by fine carving, and occasionally
the pink or orange tones of mantels of sienna marble lent a pleasing
touch of color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>In many of the apartments there were fine cornices, modillions,
and dentils. Delicately fluted pilasters often flanked windows and
doors. Elaborately carved cornice and mantel friezes and frets represented
the most skilled craftsmanship of the period. Sometimes, as at
"Carter's Grove," the miniature carving of the friezes was of exquisite
beauty. Motifs such as the egg and dart, the Wall of Troy,
and the Tudor rose were employed with fine effect.</p>

<p>In the halls ornamentation was frequently given freer scope than
elsewhere. The wide passageways which extended through the houses
were customarily broken midway by arches of fine proportions. The
usual focal point of interest in the hallways, however, was the stairs,
the sweep of which was often majestic. Carved and hidden newel
posts were common, and sometimes the pattern of the posts reappeared
in elaborate friezes below the landing. Twist-carved balusters
were placed on the steps, and running floral and foliated carving
decorated the risers or step-ends of many of the stairs.</p>

<p>For these homes the Virginia aristocrats imported furniture, china,
plate, and other furnishings from England and France. Their letters
to factors in the homeland were filled with descriptions of the articles
wanted, and frequently specified that items must be in the latest London
fashion. Choice pieces of walnut and mahogany, expensive mirrors,
and carpets and hangings of the best quality graced their drawing
rooms. Harpsichords, spinets, and other fine instruments stood
in many homes, and portraits of members of the family, some by the
best artists of the day, hung on their walls. In the dining rooms, fine
crystal and plate emblazoned with the family crest gleamed on polished
sideboards and tables.</p>

<p>Though they sometimes maintained residences at Williamsburg
for the court season, the Virginia great were rarely absentee landlords
in the sense that planters in other colonies were. Rather, they
were country gentlemen residing on their manor plantations, and, as
we have seen, seriously interested in improving their homes and domains.
A family was customarily identified by reference to its seat.
"Epping Forest," "Marmion," "Berkeley," "Chelsea," "Elsing Green,"
and the other musical names by which the homes were called, impart
a romantic and picturesque flavor to the literature of the region,
and reveal the strong hold retained over men's affections by the
mother country.</p>

<p>Since no land in the Tidewater was cleared until it was to be utilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
for tobacco culture, and since discarded fields were allowed to
grow up in thickets, the plantation establishments were generally
located at a considerable distance from one another and separated
by heavily wooded tracts.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Set in a land abounding in excellent house sites, the planters' homes
generally stood near the bank of one of the great rivers or upon some
natural eminence. In the former case these houses had two fronts,
a land and a water entrance. The approach from the public highway
generally led through a wide avenue of trees, perhaps a mile or more
in length, or the house might be shielded from the public gaze by a
park of stately beeches or poplars. Since overland routes often presented
serious difficulties, the Virginians made highroads of their
rivers and creeks, and the side of the mansion facing the water generally
constituted its true front. This is evidenced by the fact that
one usually ascended the stairs from the water side. Isolated as the
homes were, the Virginians were able to enjoy the seclusion so
greatly prized by the gentry of the mother country, and they developed
to a high degree the hospitable and generous traits and the
love of outdoor sports that have usually characterized country
squires.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The constant activity that centered about the great house is clearly
reflected in the journals, letters, and account books of the day.
Through their pages may be seen the great planter-businessmen, the
members of their families, the overseers and stewards, the free white
artisans, the Negro slaves, and the indentured servants moving about
their daily tasks. The master of the plantation in a counting room
near his mansion balances accounts, writes letters to his factors in
England, or converses with the overseers and stewards from his other
plantations who have come for instructions regarding their work.
The children of the household and their tutor pass to and from the
office used as a schoolroom. A ship from the homeland touches at the
plantation landing and its captain comes ashore to bring letters and
the latest news from the mother country, and perchance to dine at
the planter's table. Visitors from neighboring plantations or from
adjoining counties arrive in sloops or in coaches or sedans. Rooms
reserved for guests are rarely empty and almost any event serves as
the excuse for a celebration. A peripatetic dancing master arrives, the
children of the neighborhood gather, and an informal dance is held
after they have been singly instructed. Even passing strangers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
accorded hospitable entertainment and treated as welcome guests.
The planter and his family frequently ride out in a coach or chair
for "an airing" or to call upon neighbors or relatives. On Sunday, if
the weather be good, he takes his family by water to attend services
at the parish church. Not infrequently a neighbor's servant arrives
bearing venison or some other delicacy for the master's table.</p>

<p>Countless articles are bought or taken from the plantation stores.
In the smith's shop nails and other articles are forged for plantation
use, and the chair of a neighbor is mended or his plows pointed. Provisions
are sent to the outlying plantations and supplies needed for
the home place brought from them. In buildings near the mansion,
tobacco is cured and prized. Hogsheads are rolled to the wharf to be
shipped.</p>

<p>Such was the nature of the world about "Nomini Hall," the manor
house of Robert Carter III in Westmoreland County, to which Philip
Vickers Fithian, a young Princeton-bred theological student, went
as a tutor to the children of the household in 1773.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<h3>Philip Fithian And The Carter Family</h3>


<p>During his residence at "Nomini Hall" from October,
1773, to October, 1774, Philip Fithian recorded his impressions
of the life about him in a daily journal and in letters
to relatives and friends. These impressions constitute a detailed
and illuminating account. The civilization he described differed in
many respects from that he had known in New Jersey. His austere
Presbyterian training caused him to look with disfavor or misgiving
upon many of the gay diversions and other social customs of Virginia.
Yet he was open-minded to an unusual degree and not unsympathetic
to the people among whom he lived. His freshness of viewpoint led
him to comment upon various features of Virginia civilization which
would doubtless have escaped the attention of one more familiar with
them. He admired many aspects of Southern life and for the members
of the Carter household Fithian developed a genuine and lasting
fondness. The account possesses both vivacity and charm.</p>

<p>At "Nomini Hall" Philip Fithian found himself in an excellent observation
post. Robert Carter, its owner, was the scion of one of the
wealthiest and most influential Tidewater families. His great-grandfather,
John Carter, had emigrated to Virginia from England in
1649. Acquiring some 13,500 acres in the Northern Neck, the fertile
region between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, John Carter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
had established his home "Corotoman" on the Rappahannock in
Lancaster County. Becoming ere long a successful planter and businessman,
Carter served first as a Burgess and then as a member of the
governor's Council.</p>

<p>Robert or "King" Carter, son of the emigrant, so eclipsed his
father that he has usually been regarded as founder of the family in
Virginia. Bold, capable, and acquisitive, "King" Carter strove ceaselessly
to expand the family fortunes. By strict attention to business and
a close regard for his prerogatives as agent of the Fairfaxes, the proprietors
of the Northern Neck, he ultimately became the richest
and perhaps the most powerful man of his day in Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> First as
a Burgess and then as a member and President of the Council, he exerted
a political influence that contributed greatly to the management
of his private affairs. Realizing earlier than most the need
future generations would have for fresh lands, he obtained for his
progeny altogether some 333,000 acres.</p>

<p>Under the custom of primogeniture, Carter arranged that the bulk
of his lands, including "Corotoman," should go to his eldest son, John
Carter II. He, nonetheless, saw to it that his other sons, Robert, Landon,
Charles, and George should have ample estates. Robert Carter II,
however, died a few months before his father, leaving a young son,
Robert III, and a daughter, Elizabeth. A short time after "King" Carter's
death his surviving sons procured a special legislative enactment
investing the share of the estate intended for the dead son in the
young grandson. When Robert Carter III reached his majority,
therefore, he would become master of more than seventy thousand
acres.</p>

<p>The young boy's uncles, John, Landon, and Charles Carter, acted
as his guardians. As a result of his mother's early second marriage
to Colonel John Lewis, he lived at the latter's manor plantation,
"Warner Hall" in Gloucester County. When the lad was nine, he
was sent to the College of William and Mary. Nothing further is definitely
known of how his youth was spent.</p>

<p>On reaching twenty-one Robert at once began preparations for a
trip to England where he remained two years. The purpose of this
visit is not known. It is probable, however, that he was following
the example of his grandfather, his father, and the other sons of
"King" Carter who had all completed their education in the mother
country. Indeed the records of the Inner Temple reveal that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
admitted to the privileges and assumed the agreeable duties of a
member of that august legal society a few months after he arrived
there.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Whatever his motives, though, it is unlikely that a spirited
young man, possessed of ample means and free of parental restraint,
would bury himself entirely within musty college walls. Reports at
home had it that he spent his time in idleness and gay diversions. A
portrait painted at this time by a fashionable artist, probably in the
studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds, shows him arrayed in a fine doublet
of silk and a high lace collar, with a mask in one hand as if to indicate
he was about to hasten away to some masquerade.</p>

<p>Whatever his youthful follies may have been, Robert Carter possessed
a gentle and thoughtful nature. As he matured, he became increasingly
a serious man of business and of scholarly and cultivated
tastes. Returning to Virginia in 1751, he soon married and settled
down to the life of a country squire at "Nomini Hall," the manor
house his father had built in Westmoreland County.</p>

<p>On a visit to Maryland, Carter had met Frances Anne Tasker, the
sixteen-year-old daughter of one of the foremost citizens of that
colony. Struck by the beauty, good sense, and fortune of the young
girl, he had secured her consent to become his wife. Frances Tasker
Carter was an uncommon person. Notwithstanding the numerous
children she had already borne her husband when Philip Fithian
entered her household, she was still beautiful, elegant, and youthful
looking. She was also well-informed and frequently surprised Fithian
with the breadth of her interests. Ever cheerful and agreeable, she
managed the household with fine success and carefully trained her
seventeen children.</p>

<p>Besides a handsome dowry, Frances Tasker brought her husband
a family influence that proved of great assistance in both his public
and private career. Benjamin Tasker, her father, who had wide commercial
connections, had served for thirty-two years as a member and
President of the Council of Maryland, and for a period as acting-Governor.
Her mother, Anne Bladen Tasker, was the daughter of
William Bladen who had been successfully Secretary and Attorney-General
of that colony. Thomas Bladen, her mother's brother, a
former governor of Maryland, had removed to England and become
a member of Parliament for Old Sarum, where he was now in an
excellent position to promote the interests of his American relatives.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Robert Carter led a busy life at "Nomini Hall." To utilize profitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
the resources of an estate of seventy thousand acres was a
task that demanded foresight and planning. He customarily cultivated
as many as a dozen large plantations at once, and it was necessary
that the operations on the several units be carefully integrated.
Though tobacco constituted the crop of first importance on his
estate, entire plantations were sometimes devoted to producing grain
stuffs and supplies needed at "Nomini Hall" and on the other plantations.
From time to time, too, Carter sought to develop other money
crops which might supplement the constantly dwindling profits from
tobacco. The preparation of new grounds to replace discarded fields
constituted a laborious task that had to be coped with at intervals.
He set up and equipped so many plantations that he resorted at one
time to the signs of the zodiac for names for them.</p>

<p>Apart from the lands he himself cultivated, Carter rented or leased
a large proportion of his estate to others. He developed an elaborate
system of tenancy reminiscent in its principal features of the modern
lien system and "share cropping." Lands were leased for varying
periods under specific agreements as to the uses to be made of them,
the provision of tools and other supplies by the landlord, and the
proportion of the crops to be paid as rent. Other tracts were leased
for a fixed money rental.</p>

<p>To Carter's interests as a planter and a landlord he added those of a
manufacturer. When conditions made it economical or necessary to
furnish his own supplies, he operated textile factories, salt works,
grain mills, and bakeries to fill his own and his neighbors' needs. In
his smiths's shops the simple farm implements of the time were forged
and repaired, and work was also done for near-by planters. Through
his wife's relations he received a one-fifth share in the Baltimore Iron
Works. As part owner of this firm he produced bar and pig iron in
large quantities on a commercial basis, and incidentally supplied raw
materials needed on his plantations. He also carried on extensive
operations as a merchant and factor. From his stores at "Nomini
Hall," European manufactures and merchandise of every sort were
dispensed. He owned a number of vessels which regularly carried
supplies to the landings of other planters on the Virginia rivers and
the Chesapeake and took their produce off their hands. Sometimes
he provided these men with banking and credit facilities.</p>

<p>The scope of Carter's activities is indicated by the fact that at one
time his slaves numbered over 500. In addition, he employed numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
white stewards, overseers, clerks, skilled craftsmen, and
artisans. In a labor force so numerous and diversified the most careful
adjustments in human relationships were necessary. In a very
real sense Carter acted as a protector, father, physician, and court of
last resort for all his people. No complaint was too insignificant to receive
the master's consideration.</p>

<p>As part of the obligations of his station, the master of "Nomini
Hall" served as a vestryman and a warden of his church in Cople
Parish and performed other public duties. At the age of twenty-eight
he was made a member of the governor's Council. His large estate
made him eligible and his wife's uncle, Thomas Bladen, supplied the
influence in England necessary to secure his appointment to this
highest governing body in the colony. By virtue of belonging to the
Council he also served as a colonel in the militia. As was customary,
he was henceforth known as Colonel or Councillor Carter. In the
latter capacity, he went twice a year to Williamsburg to advise the
royal governor and to sit as a member of the General Court. For a
decade after 1762 he found it pleasant and convenient to live at the
Capital the greater part of the time. He acquired a residence in the
town and established his wife and children there. With the outbreak
of the disturbances which led to the Revolution, however, he returned
with his family to "Nomini Hall" where he lived during the
remainder of his active years, devoting his time to the development
of his estate and the promotion of his commercial interests, the rearing
of his family, and the quiet enjoyment of his scholarly and cultivated
tastes. Despite his many duties, he spent much time in reading
and in scientific investigation. An accomplished musician, he practiced
daily on some of the numerous instruments at his home.</p>

<p>The social life of the family at "Nomini Hall" was of the most
agreeable sort. Situated on a hill overlooking the Potomac and Nomini
rivers, the mansion was admirably suited to the hospitable tradition
of the region. A large rectangular structure of brick, covered
with stucco, the great house was surrounded by more than thirty
dependent structures or offices and presented an attractive and imposing
appearance. The four principal offices were set off at a distance
of one hundred yards from the corners of the house, and
within the rectangle formed by these buildings was a long bowling
green. Extensive and well-tended gardens provided agreeable promenades
for members of the family and guests. One approached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
mansion from the public highway through a wide avenue of poplars
which terminated in a circle about the house. Viewed through this
avenue from a distance, Fithian asserted, "Nomini Hall" appeared
"most romantic, at the same time it does truly elegant."</p>

<p>The lower floor of the great house contained the master's library,
a dining room, used also as a sitting room, a dining hall for the
children, a ballroom thirty feet long, and a hallway with a fine stairway
of black walnut. The upper rooms were used as sleeping quarters
for members of the family and for guests. The older boys and their
tutor slept above-stairs in one of the large offices that was also used
as a schoolhouse. During the time Fithian was there Carter arranged
to convert one of the lower rooms of this office into a concert or
music room. Here he proposed to place the harpsichord, harmonica,
forte-piano, guitar, violin, and German flutes which were in the great
house, and to bring up for that purpose from his Williamburg residence,
the organ which had been built for him in London according
to his own specifications.</p>

<p>Seven of the nine surviving Carter children<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the Councillor's
nephew, Harry Willis, were placed under Fithian's care. Benjamin,
the eldest son, was a quiet, studious boy of eighteen. Robert Bladen,
two years younger, loved the out-of-doors and cared little for
learning. John Tasker, only four, was too young for instruction.
Priscilla, the eldest daughter, was an attractive girl of fifteen. Anne
Tasker, called Nancy, and Frances or Fanny, whom Fithian thought
the "Flower of the Family," were thirteen and eleven respectively.
Betty Landon was ten, and Harriot Lucy, a "bold, fearless, merry
girl," was seven. Sarah Fairfax, the baby, was only a few months old
at the time Fithian arrived.</p>

<p>Apart from the members of the family, the tutor, and the numerous
domestics, various other persons maintained a more or less permanent
connection with the household. Among these were Miss Sally
Stanhope, the housekeeper, Mr. Randolph, who served as clerk and
steward for Carter, Mr. Christian, a peripatetic dancing master who
visited most of the great manor houses of the Northern Neck, Mr.
Stadley, music master to the children, and Mrs. Oakley, who had
nursed several of them at Williamsburg.</p>

<p>In no section of the colony were the great planters more numerous
than in the Northern Neck; in none did they dominate society more
completely. The families on the manor plantations associated on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
terms of intimacy. Gay assemblies, dances, balls, and banquets
brought them together frequently. Dancing masters held their classes
in rotation at the great plantation houses. At these homes their pupils
assembled in turn, frequently accompanied by parents and friends.
After the master had instructed the young men and women on these
occasions, an informal dance was generally held. These families customarily
congregated about the parish church before and after services
to enjoy social exchanges. Attendance at county court provided
another regular opportunity for commingling. Boat races, barbecues,
"Fish-feasts," and horse races brought friends together at
intervals. Sometimes elaborate private entertainments were given at
which music, feasting, and dancing continued for several days.
Rarely a day passed but found some guest at the Councillor's table.
Members of the Carter household constantly exchanged visits with
the plantation families of their neighborhood and with relatives and
friends in adjoining counties. They dined frequently with the Turbervilles
at "Hickory Hill," the Washingtons at "Bushfield," the Lees
at "Chantilly" and "Stratford," and with the more distant Tayloes at
"Mount Airy."</p>

<p>With all these persons the young Princeton tutor was familiar. He
accompanied the Carters frequently when they dined at their friends'
tables, he attended banquets and balls with them, conversed with the
people of the vicinity at the parish churches, met them at races, and
observed their conduct as guests at "Nomini Hall." The sprightly interest
with which Fithian comments upon these men and women
and their way of life makes them seem as real today as then.</p>

<p>For more than a century the manuscript of Fithian's journal and
the letters he wrote home remained unpublished. During that time,
some years apparently after Philip's death, his brother, Enoch, assembled
the letters and papers and the various sections of the journal
kept over a period of years and copied them in several bound volumes
from the loose and various-sized sheets upon which they were
written. It is from this transcript that the journal is known today,
and the irregularities in punctuation, spelling, and capitalization in
the form in which it has been preserved are doubtless due largely to
this fact.</p>

<p>The journal kept at "Nomini Hall" and a group of letters written
by Fithian during his residence there were finally published in 1900
by the Princeton University Library, into whose custody had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
seven manuscript volumes of Fithian's papers in Enoch Fithian's
hand. This publication was edited by John Rogers Williams, a member
of the Princeton Historical Association.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> A small part of the
journal and certain letters which the editor regarded as "of too intimate
and personal or too trivial a character" were omitted, his object
being "in general to present such as have some bearing on historic
places and personages, together with representative ones showing"
Fithian's "character and circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The editor, moreover, was
interested in Fithian's manuscripts primarily from the standpoint of
the tutor's association with Princeton.</p>

<p>In the present edition the manuscripts have been treated with special
reference to the light they throw on life in the Old Dominion.
The journal kept at "Nomini Hall" and all the letters written by
Fithian from Virginia are given in their entirety. Several letters written
after his departure from "Nomini Hall," but which relate to
matters and persons in Virginia, are now printed for the first time.</p>

<p>The journal and letters of Philip Fithian are so revealing of his personality
that one inevitably becomes attached to the young tutor, and
the reader today may well be curious to know his subsequent career.
Having prepared himself for the Presbyterian ministry, Fithian left
the Carter household late in 1774 despite the strong ties of friendship
and gratitude which now bound him to the family. His decision to
return to New Jersey was influenced both by a sense of duty and
his growing attachment for Elizabeth Beatty, the "fair Laura" of his
journal. In December, 1774, he was licensed to preach by the Presbytery
of Philadelphia. That winter he filled vacancies in West Jersey
and the following summer served as a Presbyterian missionary in
the Valley of Virginia and Pennsylvania. He married Elizabeth
Beatty in October, 1775. Early in 1776 he enlisted as a chaplain in the
Revolutionary forces. Shortly after the battle of White Plains he
died as the result of an attack of dysentery and exposure in camp.
Though his promise to visit the family at "Nomini Hall" again was
never fulfilled, the letters he wrote to members of the Carter household
after his departure reveal the tender regard in which all were
held.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir.</span></p>

<p>I expected notwithstanding your small offence you would have let
me know before this time whether you had made any determination
different from what you designed when I left you. If you design
teaching before you get into business, there are now several considerable
offers made to young men who are willing to go to Virginia by
some of the first gentlemen in the colony; one particularly who will
give as good as 60, the best accomodations, a room to study in
and the advantage of a library, a horse kept and a servant to wait
upon you.</p>

<p>Dr Witherspoon<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is very fond of getting a person to send him. I
make no kind of doubt but if you were to write to the doctor but he
would engage it to you, the terms are exactly as I write you as I have
informed myself that I might let you know&mdash;</p>

<p>There are a number of our friends and class-mates getting into
business as fast as possible, whether they are called or not I cannot
pretend to judge, this much I would say that I think it is not any
ones duty to run too fast. No less than four Debow, Reese, McCorkle,
Allen, under trials by a presbytery, and Bryan<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> trying to get
license to plead law in some of the best courts on the continent, if infamy
were law or lies were Gospel he might get license either to
plead or preach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>We have had the pleasure of Laura's<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> company here for some
weeks past, I hope you will not envy us considering that continual
pleasure is too much for such mortals as we to bear.</p>

<p>I beg that you may no longer refrain from writing, as I should
be very glad to hear many things from you and other of my friends
in Cohansie which you can relate with little trouble. If you have
been trying with me who could keep from writing longest, I own
fairly beat. The number of our students are considerably increased,
and our school consists of thirty-nine&mdash;I have heard there are some
disagreeable stories going through your country I wish you would
let me know something about them. Doctr Ward spent part of
yesterday with me in his return.</p>

<p>Rose at five. Read in the greek Testament, the third Chapter of the
Acts. Breakfasted at seven. Busy the greater part of this Day in
coppying off some loose miscellanous Pieces. P. M. Read the Spectator
in my Course. Received in the Evening, by the Stage, a Letter from
Mr and: Hunter jur In which he invites me to remove, &amp; accept a
School, of very considerable Consequence, in Virginia. He also informs
me that four of our Class-Mates, are on Trial, under a Presbytery,
for Preachers; &amp; one has applied for Licence to plead Law in
Maryland; Poor Boys! hard they push to be in the midst of Tumult,
&amp; Labour.</p>

</p>

<p>I am sorry you impute neglect of writing in me to so wrong a
cause, as an old trivial offense, I confess that I am to blame, and am
willing to stand reproved by you, for having been so long silent. If
I should offer any thing in excuse it would be great hurry arising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from the duty of my station, on which account I have wrote only two
or three letters since you left us. The school in town, which I had
in view, as I make no doubt you know, is now occupied by Mr
<i>Lynn</i>. And the terms of the school at <i>Blandensburg</i> are I think too
low, to divert me from the course of my business. I would not however
forego a good offer in a school abroad, for some short time.
What you write concerning the offer of a Gentleman in Virginia, is,
I think of considerable consequence, provided the conditions of
teaching are not over burdensome; I should speedily agree to go and
apply for the place, were I made satisfied as to this.</p>

<p>I shall however, beg the assistance of your friendship, to enquire
in what county the school is; what number and degrees of scholars
there are; and if you think the place suitable, and if the Docter shall
think proper to appoint me to it, I am not unwilling to remove and
accept it. Please to mention this to the Docter; and if he has not engaged
a teacher, and is pleased to accept me, I hope you will acquaint
me as speedily as may be, with what you can learn as to the time
of beginning, the custom of the school, &amp;c. You mentioned four in
your last, who have applied to Presbytery, and are on tryal, I can
tell you another, Mr Heith; he applied to the Philadelphia Presbytery;
but came to town, I understood so late, that before he made application
the Presbytery was dissolved, some of the Members however,
being still in town, at his request, gave him sundry pieces of
exercise, which it is expected the Presbytery will acknowledge, so
that he is the fifth out of our class who is designing soon to appear in
public!</p>

<p><i>Fryday july 30.</i></p>

<p>Rose pretty early. Breakfasted with Mrs <i>Buck</i>. Wrote a Note, after
Breakfast to Holinshead. Soon after which, I set out for Home, &amp; by
the favour of a young man who lodges at Mr Bucks I rode to the
Ferry, &amp; was home by eleven.</p>

<p>Received several Letters by the Stage to Day; One especially from
Mr Hunter, in which I am pressed to accept the proposal by the
Gentleman in Virginia. The Offer is very proffitable; Colonel <i>Carter</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
has four Sons. To a private Tutor for which he proposes to give
sixty-five Pounds pr Year; find him all Accomodations; Allow him
a Room for his own Study; And the Use of an eligant Library of
Books; A Horse to ride; &amp; a Servant to Wait. I am inclined to go,
but dont meet with much Encouragement from those who have the
Direction of my Studies.</p>

<p>We had Company in the Afternoon; &amp; expected Miss <i>Grimes</i>, &amp;
Miss Ewing, til Evening, but they never came.</p>


<p><i>Saturday july 31.</i></p>

<p>Rose early. After Breakfast rode to Deerfield, &amp; consulted with
Mr Green<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but he gives only his usual Indifference; Dined at Mr

returned in the Evening to Greenwich.</p>


<p><i>Sunday. August 1:</i></p>

<p>Rose pretty early. Attended the Funeral of Mr <i>Hugh Stethern</i>.
who died yesterday morning. Many are now ill of what is called the
<i>Fall Fever</i>.</p>

<p>Mr <i>Hunter</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> preached both Parts of the Day.</p>


<p><i>Monday August 2.</i></p>

<p>Concluded, this Day, with the Concurrence of Mr <i>Hunter</i>, to set
of for Princeton, &amp; know of Dr Witherspoon something more particular
concerning the Proposal for my going to <i>Virginia</i>. Busy all
the Afternoon in preparing to go.&mdash;Evening very hot. Went on foot
to the Stage.&mdash;Drank a Bowl of Punch with Mr <i>Richard</i> Howel, &amp; to
bed by ten.</p>


<p><i>Monday August 9</i></p>

<p>Waited on Dr Witherspoon, about nine o Clock, to hear his Proposal
for my going to <i>Virginia</i>&mdash;He read me a Letter which he
receivd from Col: Carter, &amp; proposed the following Terms&mdash;To
teach his Children, five Daughters, &amp; three Sons, who are from five
to seventeen years Old&mdash;The young Ladies are to be taught the English
Language. And the Boys are to study the English Language carefully;
&amp; to be instructed in the Latin, &amp; Greek&mdash;And he proposes to
give thirty five Pounds Sterling, which is about Sixty Pounds currency;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Provide all Accommodations; Allow him the undisturbed Use
of a Room; And the Use of his own Library; find Provender for a
Horse; &amp; a Servant to Wait&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>&mdash;By the Advice of the Dr &amp; his Recommendation of the Gentleman,
&amp; the Place, I accepted the Offer, &amp; agreed to go in the Fall into
<i>Virginia</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>I took this morning, from Dr Wiggins, a Balsam that has removed
the Pain wholly from my Breast; he called it the Balsam of <i>Cappewee</i>.
Probably I spell it Wrong.</p>

Voyage; But sick or sorry I must away&mdash;I waited on the Dr,
But he has yet received no Intelligence.</p>

<p>After Evening-Prayrs, by particular Requests, I attended in the

<p>If I could only tell you the Incidents of Yesterday, you would
laugh as loud &amp; as cordially as ever&mdash;Smith did all the Oddities of
Miss Cateness.</p>

<p>I was, &amp; for my Life, could not avoid, being dumpish &amp; melancholy,
in the midst of Humour &amp; Pleasantry&mdash;Smith<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> was in great Distress
on Account of his approaching Examination; He is in the Senior-Class,
&amp; that Class is to be examined for their Degree tomorrow, so
that he too was sour all Day.&mdash;Directly opposite to both was your
Brother; he was noisy, &amp; troublesome; We dined at Mr Irwin's. Your
Brother kindly rode with us to the Ferry, where we parted; he for
Mr McConkey's; We for Princeton. I am to day happy as Amusements
&amp; good-Company, in this lovely Habitation of the Muses, can
render me.</p>

<p>There is yet, among my Acquaintances, a young Lady; &amp; She is
also, I firmly believe, one of your most agreeable Intimates, whose
Friendship I think so valuable, &amp; whose Manner every Way, is so
peculiarly engaging, that if you should soon see her, whom you have
sometimes heard me call Laura, give my Duty, my Love to her, &amp;
acquaint her with what I have often told you of her, that She is, in
my undisguised Oppinion, "A Pattern for Female Excellence."</p>

<p>Tell her also, that a singular, &amp; very important Occurrence, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
has lately presented itself to me, seems to make it necessary, if it be
any how agreeable to her, She should in some Way, chosen by Herself,
signify to you that I may thereby know, whether She favours
or dislikes what I have told her.</p>

<p>I assure you, Madam, so strong is the Esteem I have for that dear
Girl, which certainly I shall ever retain, that neither, Place, nor Time,
nor any Alteration in my Condition of Life, will blot it out.</p>

<p>This, however, I intrust only to you, &amp; put so great Confidence in
the many Expressions of your Friendship for me, that I hope you
will use your Influence to persuade her that what I write is Truth.</p>

<p>I expect to leave Deerfield<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> &amp; go Home next Week; But I am not
determined yet upon going to Virginia. Dr Witherspoon desires &amp;
advises me to go&mdash;My Directors here seem backward, &amp; rather unwilling.&mdash;I

I shall go down in October. But whether I do the one or the

<p>As an old Sinner, who has been long accustomed to Mishief, cannot
bear to think of quitting his much-loved Practice; so I, from Time
to Time, with few Returns, am intruding my Epistles upon you.</p>

<p>I have just been reading Yorrick's celebrated Letters to Eliza:
They are familiar&mdash;They are plain&mdash;They are beautiful. I love Eliza,
from the admirable Description he has given of her: But possibly he
has been wholly romantic; &amp; only painted the Woman he could love;
or, if has given his own candid Sentiments, &amp; described that Woman
in Truth; There is in America an Eliza I would venture, from Yorricks
own Picture, to set against it; &amp; let Yorrick himself be Judge,
should I venture never so largely, I am sure I should succeed&mdash;</p>

<p>I was, yesterday, at Deerfield, &amp; heard News enough&mdash;I was told
that a civil, good looking Gentleman; who had been lately from
N&mdash;n, told them he saw me there with you&mdash;That I was wild, &amp; noisy&mdash;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
thinks I shall make a damn'd droll Figure in a Pulpit, with
Powdered-Hair; a long Cue; &amp; deep Ruffles!&mdash;I fancy myself it would
appear odd!&mdash;I was told there also every Circumstance of our Ride
from Princeton to N&mdash;n. Of my being with your Brother in Philadelphia
as I went up, &amp; returned&mdash;Of almost the whole of my Company
&amp; Conduct while in Town.</p>

<p>It is something curious, tho' by no Means troublesome, that every
part of my Behaviour, is in whatever Place I go, so circumstantially
inspected.&mdash;I shall suppress all I heard of you, only that you are soon
to be married, &amp; I should not have mentioned this, but that I might
let you know it was told in Triumph to dash me!&mdash;Yet if it had
wounded my Soul I would have sustained &amp; concealed the Pain, to
outbrave such Insolence! I cannot help, however, when I am alone in
my Chamber, reflecting on the Danger of the Impropriety I may
possibly be guilty of in thus continuing my Intimacy with you.</p>

<p>But I turn it all off with a Smile, &amp;, if the Report be true, with a
Wish, in the Language of the Poet Walter to a Lady of his Acquaintance
"That you may possess all your Wishes, as to earthly Happiness
&amp; Comfort, in the Society of him whom you have preferr'd to the
rest of Men; &amp; that you may feel as much for him, of that Anxiety
which arises from Esteem, as others have felt for you"&mdash;I am going,
next Month to Virginia, unless the Remonstrances of my Relations
prevail with me to decline it.</p>

<p>But on I go little thinking how much I may incur your Censure by
writing so freely, &amp; so long&mdash;O Laura, I wish most ardently, that I
could with Propriety, from the present Moment, spend all my hours
near your Person.&mdash;They would then, with their purple Wings, fly
along through the Sorrows, &amp; Tumults of Life, wholly unnoticed.</p>

<p>I would have the spelling of your name corrected, but the catalogue

<p>I hope the World is using you very well, &amp; that you enjoy yourself
in Contentment; &amp; the Society of your Friends with Pleasure. The
Reason of my saying this, is, because many People here are often
enquiring about you; Where you live? How you do? When you
will return? The Cause of your Absence?&mdash;And forty other things
that none knows, or ought to speak of, but yourself.</p>

<p>You inform me that you propose to be at the approaching Commencement:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
It will not be in my Power, with any Convenience, to
go&mdash;I can, however, give you a Caution; Let not Pity so much affect
you, nor Fear so much alarm you, as again, (you remember last Fall)
to excite Tears in your Eyes, or one sorrowful Ake in your Breast,
if any of Nassau's bold Sons shall attempt once more, to support their
Right by suppressing Impertinence &amp; Violence.</p>

<p>There are many going from Philada &amp;, I am told, some Ladies of
Note &amp; Eminence&mdash;There are many expected from the Southern
Colonies&mdash;And, because of the Connexions, many from York, &amp; the
New-England Goverments. The Assembly, no Doubt, will be large,
&amp; splendid&mdash;And I hope the Exercises may be worthy their Attention
&amp; Approbation. Nothing hinders my being there but only my Purpose
of going soon to the Southward.</p>

<p>I may not omitt telling you that&mdash;Smith as we were returning Home,
pitied you from his Heart; An agreeable, &amp; sensible young Lady,
separated from genteel Society, &amp; prisoned in a Room in the Woods,
in the Midst of an unpleasant Country, like a penitent Virgin conscious
of her Sins, voluntarily retiring to a lonely Monastary!&mdash;But
he forgot, Laura, that infelt Peace, makes us always happy, even tho'
our Circumstances be apparently distressful.</p>

I am, Eliza,<br />

<p><i>Wednesday. Sept: 15.</i></p>

<p>Rose at seven; slept but little for I was affraid&mdash;Breakfasted on
Oysters, at the Ferry-Mans, with John Holmes, Esq:&mdash;Had an Hours
Conversation with him, on Lotteries&mdash;Whether they are just &amp; lawful&mdash;He
thinks not&mdash;At ten we came up to his Brother Benjamin
Holmes's Esq:&mdash;They mentioned to me an Intention they have to
erect, &amp; establish a School, among them, that their Children may be
taught, Latin, Greek, &amp; the Practical Branches in Mathematicks&mdash;They
desired to know if it would be convenient, &amp; agreeable for me
to undertake with them, to prosecute their Plan. But I must, with
Doubt, away to <i>Virginia</i>&mdash;It would be a laudable undertaking if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
such a School could be founded in this Part of our Province; &amp; I
think ought to be duely encouraged&mdash;</p>

<p>I left Mr Holmes's about twelve, &amp; came to Mr Hunters about
four, seventeen Miles&mdash;Evening walked Home. Expence 2s/0.</p>


<p><i>Sunday. Sept: 19.</i></p>

<p>Rose half after six&mdash;Read some in Pictete&mdash;Walked to Sermon by
ten; Smith Rode in order to go home with Mr Hunter after Sermon&mdash;Dr
Ward seems very low, confined commonly to his Bed; the
Disorder it is to be feared is a Consumption, &amp; increases in malignity
almost daily&mdash;How much will Cohansie feel his Death if by this
Illness he is soon taken of, or by the Violence of it wholly disabled
to practice among us, who has been so long successful in his Work!
Received a Letter late last Night from Mr Hunter at College, and
He informs me that the Dr insists on my Going to Virginia&mdash;</p>

Decemr 1st 1773.</p>

<span class="smcap">Revd Sir.</span><br />
</p>

<p>As you desired I may not omit to inform you, so far as I can by a
letter, of the business in which I am now engaged, it would indeed
be vastly agreeable to me if it was in my power to give you particular
intelligence concerning the state and plan of my employment here.</p>

<p>I set out from home the 20th of Octr and arrived at the Hon:
Robert Carters, of Nominy, in Westmorland County, the 28th I
began to teach his children the first of November. He has two sons,
and one Nephew; the oldest Son is turned of seventeen, and is reading
Salust and the greek grammer; the others are about fourteen, and
in english grammer, and Arithmetic. He has besides five daughters
which I am to teach english, the eldest is turned of fifteen, and is
reading the spectator; she is employed two days in every week in
learning to play the Forte-Piana, and Harpsicord&mdash;The others are
smaller, and learning to read and spell. Mr Carter is one of the Councellors
in the general court at Williamsburg, and possest of as great,
perhaps the clearest fortune according to the estimation of people
here, of any man in Virginia: He seems to be a good scholar, even in
classical learning, and is remarkable one in english grammar; and
notwithstanding his rank, which in general seems to countenance indulgence
to children, both himself and Mrs Carter have a manner
of instructing and dealing with children far superior, I may say it
with confidence, to any I have ever seen, in any place, or in any
family. They keep them in perfect subjection to themselves, and
never pass over an occasion of reproof; and I blush for many of my
acquaintances when I say that the children are more kind and complaisant
to the servants who constantly attend them than we are to
our superiors in age and condition. Mr Carter has an over-grown
library of Books of which he allows me the free use. It consists of a
general collection of law books, all the Latin and Greek Classicks,
vast number of Books on Divinity chiefly by writers who are of the
established Religion; he has the works of almost all the late famous
writers, as Locke, Addison, Young, Pope, Swift, Dryden, &amp;c. in
Short, Sir, to speak moderately, he has more than eight times your
number<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>&mdash;His eldest Son, who seems to be a Boy of Genius and application
is to be sent to Cambridge University, but I believe will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
through a course either in Philadelphia or Princeton College first. As
to what is commonly said concerning Virginia that it is difficult to
avoid being corrupted with the manners of the people, I believe it is
founded wholly in a mistaken notion that persons must, when here
frequent all promiscuous assemblies; but this is so far from truth that
any one who does practise it, tho' he is accused of no crime, loses at
once his character; so that either the manners have been lately
changed, or the report is false, for he seems now to be best esteemed
and most applauded who attends to his business, whatever it be, with
the greatest diligence. I believe the virginians have of late altered their
manner very much, for they begin to find that their estates by even
small extravagance, decline, and grow involved with debt, this seems
to be the spring which induces the People of fortune who are the
pattern of all behaviour here, to be frugal, and moderate. You may
expect me at home by the permission of Providence the latter end of
april next, or the beginning of May; and as I proposed I shall present
my exercises for the examination of the Presbytery; and if they think
proper I shall gladly accept of a licence in the fall: I must beg your
favour to mention me to such of my acquaintances in Deerfield as
you think proper, but especially to Mrs Green, Miss <i>Betsy</i>, your family,
and Mrs Pecks&mdash;I must also beg you to transmit so much of this
intelligence to Mr Hunter as that my relations in Greenwich may
know that I am through the mercy of heaven in good health. I beg,
Sir, you will not fail to write, and let it be known to Mr Hunter, that
a letter will come as secure by the Post as from Cohansie to Philadelphia;
the Letters are to be directed to me thus, To Mr Philip V.
Fithian at Mr <i>Carters</i> of Nominy, to be left at Hobes Hole<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

to the Eastern Shore in Maryland, for Oysters: there are of the party,
Mr <i>Carter</i>, Captain <i>Walker</i>, Colonel <i>Richd Lee</i>, &amp; Mr <i>Lancelot Lee</i>.
With Sailors to work the vessel&mdash;I observe it is a general custom on
Sundays here, with Gentlemen to invite one another home to dine,
after Church; and to consult about, determine their common business,
either before or after Service&mdash;It is not the Custom for Gentlemen
to go into Church til Service is beginning, when they enter in a Body,
in the same manner as they come out; I have known the Clerk to
come out and call them in to prayers.&mdash;They stay also after the Service
is over, usually as long, sometimes longer, than the Parson was
preaching&mdash;Almost every Lady wears a red Cloak; and when they
ride out they tye a white handkerchief over their Head and face, so
that when I first came into Virginia, I was distress'd whenever I saw
a Lady, for I thought She had the Tooth-Ach!&mdash;The People are extremely
hospitable, and very polite both of which are most certainly
universal Characteristics of the Gentlemen in Virginia&mdash;some swear
bitterly, but the practise seems to be generally disapproved&mdash;I have
heard that this Country is notorious for Gaming, however this be, I
have not seen a Pack of <i>Cards</i>, nor a <i>Die</i>, since I left home, nor gaming
nor Betting of any kind except at the Richmond-Race. Almost every
Gentleman of Condition, keeps a Chariot and <i>Four</i>; many drive with
six Horses&mdash;I observe that all the Merchants &amp; shopkeepers in the
Sphere of my acquaintance and I am told it is the case through the
Province, are young Scotch-Men; Several of whom I know, as <i>Cunningham,
Jennings, Hamilton, Blain</i>;&mdash;And it has been the custom
heretofore to have all their Tutors, and Schoolmasters from Scotland,
tho' they begin to be willing to employ their own Countrymen&mdash;Evening
Ben Carter and myself had a long dispute on the practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
fighting&mdash;He thinks it best for two persons who have any dispute to
go out in good-humour &amp; fight manfully, &amp; says they will be sooner
and longer friends than to brood and harbour malice&mdash;Mr <i>Carter</i> is
practising this Evening on the <i>Guittar</i> He begins with the <i>Trumpet

<p><i>Teusday 14.</i></p>

<p>Busy in School&mdash;The Weather vastly fine! There has been no Rain
of consequence, nor any stormy or disagreeable Weather, since about
the 10th of last Month! From the Window, by which I write, I have
a broad, a diversified, and an exceedingly beautiful Prospect of the
high craggy Banks of the River <i>Nominy</i>! Some of those huge Hills
are cover'd thick with <i>Cedar</i>, &amp; Pine Shrubs; A vast quantity of
which seems to be in almost every part of this Province&mdash;Others are
naked, &amp; when the Sun Shines look beautiful! At the Distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
about 5 Miles is the River Potowmack over which I can see the
smoky Woods of Maryland; At this window I often stand, and
cast my Eyes homeward with peculiar pleasure! Between my window
and the potowmack, is Nominy Church, it stands close on the Bank
of the River Nominy, in a pleasant agreeable place, Mr Carters family
go down often, so many as can with convenience in a Boat rowed by
four Men, and generally arrive as soon as those who ride.</p>

<p>The mouth of Nominy River where it falls into Potowmack is
about 25 miles above the mouth of Potowmack or where it falls into
the Chessapeak-Bay. And about 12 Miles below the mouth of Nominy
the River Ucomico<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> puts up into the country, near which River,
and about three miles from the mouth stands the lower parish Church
of Westmorland County call'd Ucomic Church.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The River Potowmack
opposite to us the People say is 18 miles over, but I think it is
not more than 8. Afternoon Captain Grigg,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> who arrived last Sunday
moning into the River Ucomico from London visited Mr Carter.
Evening reading Picteete.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 15.</i></p>

<p>Busy in School&mdash;To day Dined with us Mrs Turburville, &amp; her
Daughter Miss Letty<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Miss Jenny Corbin, &amp; Mr Blain. We dined at
three. The manner here is different from our way of living in Cohansie&mdash;In
the morning so soon as it is light a Boy knocks at my
Door to make a fire; after the Fire is kindled, I rise which now in the
winter is commonly by Seven, or a little after, By the time I am drest
the Children commonly enter the School-Room, which is under the
Room I sleep in; I hear them round one lesson, when the Bell rings
for eight o-Clock (for Mr Carter has a large good Bell of upwards of
60 Lb. which may be heard some miles, &amp; this is always rung at meal
Times;) the Children then go out; and at half after eight the Bell rings
for Breakfast, we then repair to the Dining-Room; after Breakfast,
which is generally about half after nine, we go into School, and sit
til twelve, when the Bell rings, &amp; they go out for noon; the dinner-Bell
rings commonly about half after two, often at three, but never
before two.&mdash;After dinner is over, which in common, when we have
no Company, is about half after three we go into School, &amp; sit til the
Bell rings at five, when they separate til the next morning; I have to
myself in the Evening, a neat Chamber, a large Fire, Books, &amp; Candle
&amp; my Liberty, either to continue in the school room, in my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Room or to sit over at the great House with Mr &amp; Mrs Carter&mdash;We
go into Supper commonly about half after eight or at nine &amp; I
usually go to Bed between ten and Eleven. Altho the family in which
I live, is certainly under as good political Regulations, and every way
as suitable &amp; agreeable as I can expect, or even could desire; &amp; though
the Neighbourhood is polite, &amp; the Country pleasant, yet I cannot
help reflecting on my situation last winter, which was near the lovely
<i>Laura</i> for whom I cannot but have the truest, and the warmest Esteem!
possibly, If Heaven shall preserve my life, in some future time,
I may again enjoy her good society.</p>

<p>Mr Carter heard this Evening that Captain <i>Walker</i> cannot go to
Maryland, he is thus stop'd.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 16.</i></p>

<p>I can only to day write down my Misfortune; my poor Horse as he
was feeding in a miry Bottom, walked upon a sharp Stick, which
stuck into his Thigh on the under Side about four Inches below his
Flank!&mdash;The stick went in more than three Inches!&mdash;He is very lame,
but they tell me will recover, The Hostler, when we had lead him
to the Stable, applied Spirits of Turpentine to the part, and in the
Evening is to fill it with Comfrey Roots pounded Soft.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of walking to Day at twelve o-Clock with Mrs
Carter; She shewed me her stock of <i>Fowls</i> &amp; <i>Mutton</i> for the winter;
She observed, with great truth, that to live in the Country, and take
no pleasure at all in Groves, Fields, or Meadows; nor in Cattle,
Horses, &amp; domestic Poultry, would be a manner of life too tedious to
endure; Dined at three.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 17.</i></p>

<p>I dismissed the children this morning til' monday on account of
Mr Christian's <i>Dance</i>, which, as it goes through his Scholars in Rotation,
happens to be here to Day&mdash;and I myself also am unwell, so as
not to go out;&mdash;Mrs Carter sent me over Coffee for Breakfast; &amp; soon
after some Spirits of <i>Hartshorn</i> for my Head&mdash;At twelve she sent the
waiting Man to know if I was better, &amp; what I would choose for
Dinner. I thank'd her, &amp; desired that She would give herself no trouble;
She was careful, however, from her undistinguished kindness, to
send me before Dinner some hot <i>Barley Broth</i>,&mdash;<i>Ben Carter</i> before
Noon introduced into my Room, Mr <i>Billy Booth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> a young Gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of Fortune, who is one of Mr Christians pupils&mdash;The two Master
Fantleroys came in also to see me&mdash;There came to the dance
three <i>Chariots</i>, two <i>Chairs</i>, &amp; a number of Horses. Towards Evening
I grew Better, &amp; walked down, with a number of young Fellows
to the River; after our return I was strongly solicited by the
young Gentlemen to go in and dance I declined it, however, and
went to my Room not without Wishes that it had been a part of my
Education to learn what I think is an innocent and an ornamental,
and most certainly, in this province is a necessary qualification for a
person to appear even decent in Company!&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <i>Carter</i> in the Evening, sent me for Supper, a Bowl of hot
Green Tea, &amp; several <i>Tarts</i>. I expected that they would have danced
til late in the Night, but intirely contrary to my Expectation, the
Company were separated to their respective apartments before half
after nine o<i>Clock</i>.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 18.</i></p>

<p>Rose by Seven, Sent for Mr Carters Barber and was drest for
Breakfast&mdash;We went in to Breakfast at ten;&mdash;I confess I have been
seldom more dash'd than when I entered the dining-Room, for I
must of necessity be interrogated by Mr <i>Carter</i> before them all,
about my indisposition, and if I was better.&mdash;I went through the
several Ceremonies with as much resolution, and speed as possible,
and soon mixed with the Company in promiscuous conversation.
There were present of Grown persons Mr &amp; Mrs. <i>Carter</i>, Mrs <i>Lee</i>,
&amp; Miss <i>Jenny Corbin</i>; young Misses about Eleven: &amp; Seven young
Fellows, including myself;&mdash;After Breakfast, we all retired into the
Dancing-Room, &amp; after the Scholars had their Lesson singly round
Mr Christian, very politely, requested me to step a <i>Minuet</i>; I excused
myself however, but signified my peculiar pleasure in the Accuracy
of their performance&mdash;There were several Minuets danced with
great ease and propriety; after which the whole company Joined in
country-dances,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and it was indeed beautiful to admiration, to see
such a number of young persons, set off by dress to the best Advantage,
moving easily, to the sound of well performed Music, and
with perfect regularity, tho' apparently in the utmost Disorder&mdash;The
Dance continued til two, we dined at half after three&mdash;soon after
Dinner we repaired to the Dancing-Room again; I observe in the
course of the lessons, that Mr Christian is punctual, and rigid in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
discipline, so strict indeed that he struck two of the young Misses for
a fault in the course of their performance, even in the presence of the
Mother of one of them! And he rebuked one of the young Fellows
so highly as to tell him he must alter his manner, which he had observed
through the Course of the Dance, to be insolent, and wanton,
or absent himself from the School&mdash;I thought this a sharp reproof,
to a young Gentleman of seventeen, before a large number of Ladies!&mdash;When
it grew too dark to dance, the young Gentlemen walked
over to my Room, we conversed til half after six; Nothing is now to
be heard of in conversation, but the <i>Balls</i>, the <i>Fox-hunts</i>, the fine
<i>entertainments</i>, and the <i>good fellowship</i>, which are to be exhibited
at the approaching <i>Christmas</i>.&mdash;I almost think myself happy that
my Horses lameness will be sufficient Excuse for my keeping at
home on these Holidays.&mdash;Mr Goodlet<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> was barr'd out of his School
last Monday by his Scholars, for the Christmas Holidays, which are
to continue til twelfth-day; But my Scholars are of a more quiet
nature, and have consented to have four or five Days now, and to
have their full Holiday in May next, when I propose by the permission
of Providence to go Home, where I hope to see the good and
benevolent <i>Laura</i>.</p>

<p>When the candles were lighted we all repaired, for the last time,
into the dancing Room; first each couple danced a Minuet; then all
joined as before in the country Dances, these continued till half after
Seven when Mr Christian retired; and at the proposal of several,
(with Mr Carters approbation) we played <i>Button</i>, to get Pauns for
Redemption; here I could join with them, and indeed it was carried
on with sprightliness, and Decency; in the course of redeeming my
Pauns, I had several Kisses of the Ladies!&mdash;Early in the Evening cam
colonel Philip Lee,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> in a travelling Chariot from Williamsburg&mdash;Half
after eight we were rung in to Supper; The room looked luminous
and splendid; four very large candles burning on the table where
we supp'd, three others in different parts of the Room; a gay, sociable
Assembly, &amp; four well instructed waiters!&mdash;So soon as we rose from
supper, the Company form'd into a semicircle round the fire, &amp; Mr
Lee, by the voice of the Company was chosen <i>Pope</i>, and Mr Carter,
Mr Christian, Mrs <i>Carter</i>, Mrs <i>Lee</i>, and the rest of the company were
appointed Friars, in the play call'd "break the Popes neck"&mdash;Here
we had great Diversion in the respective Judgments upon offenders,
but we were all dismiss'd by ten, and retired to our several Rooms.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><i>Sunday 19.</i></p>

<p>Early this morning, I was awaked out of sleep by two youngsters,
(for we are thronged with company, so that two slept in my Room)
who were agreeing upon a Ride the Day after Christmas, (which will
be Sunday) up to Fredricksburg, which lies upon the Rapahannock,
fifty Miles higher up the country than where we live;&mdash;Breakfasted
at nine, soon after which all our company dispersed; I had the offer
of a Horse, &amp; was strongly solicited to go to Church, but I declined
it&mdash;My Horse is very lame, his Thigh, from the sore down to his knee
is much swell'd!&mdash;It runs however, and the Hostler tells me it is
mending. Dined at three; Miss Betsy Lee<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> dined with us&mdash;Writing
to day my Sermon for the Presbitery. Sup'd on Oysters.</p>

<p>This is the first day I have missed Church.</p>


<p><i>Monday 20.</i></p>

<p>Rose at half after Seven; the Morning extremely cold&mdash;We had in
School to Day as visitors Miss Betsy, and Miss Matilda Lee<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Mr Carter
gave me for his Daughter Nancy to Read, the "Compleat Letter-writer"&mdash;Also
he put into my hands for the use of the School, "the
British-Grammar."</p>


<p><i>Teusday 21.</i></p>

<p>Rose by Half after seven&mdash;the weather serene but sharp and cold.&mdash;To
day, before Dinner called in and stayed a short time Mr <i>Blain</i>
and Mr <i>Lee</i> who were going to one Mr Lanes<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> to a <i>Christning</i>, which
I understand is one of the chief times for Diversion here&mdash;Miss <i>Carter</i>,
this afternoon told me that her Mama thought of giving a small
<i>Ball</i> at the approaching Christmas for select friends.</p>

<p>If these shall be so fortunate, as to come to your Hands, I beg leave
to acquaint you that I am as agreeably settled as I can possibly be
when so remote from the chief object of my Esteem on Earth&mdash;And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that I am, &amp; have been, since I left Home, through the Kindness
of Heaven, in good Health.</p>

<p>You will be surprized if I tell you that I should have been now in
Cohansie, had I never seen you, or had you been less uncertain of
your future Purpose! That you may not be wholly without a Reason
for what I say, I must tell you, that in your Absence last Summer I
found it difficult to restrain myself from Writing frequently to you;
And after I was compell'd, tho' unwilling, to believe that you would
grant me no Return; lest I should be troublesome or impertinent,
when I had an advantageous Offer from the Gentleman with whom
I now reside, I determined to leave Home a few Months. So far I
have jested&mdash;But to be serious, Laura, I hope to see you in the Spring
as I propose to be at Home by the Beginning of May&mdash;Perhaps the
fine Air; the sprightly Conversation; the sociable Balls; &amp; various
Pleasures so common here, will have made so very a "Coxcomb" of
musty Philander, that you will blush to confess you ever knew him!
Be not hasty to judge&mdash;Possibly, on the other Hand, Laura; even
Laura, may appear so dull &amp; unfashionable that Philander tho' a
Coxcomb will look down &amp; despise her&mdash;No Laura, for tho, we have
fine Ladies; Gay Fellows, charming Music; rich &amp; I may say luxurious
Entertainment; to all which I am almost every Week strongly invited;
Yet I find greater Pleasure at Home, where I have every
genteel Accomodation I could wish, and a Family of lovely Children
to instruct&mdash;You would envy me if I was able to tell you how kind,
obedient, &amp; beautiful the Children are which I teach!&mdash;I have three
Boys the youngest of which is about the Age &amp; Size of your Brother
R&mdash;Also five Girls between five &amp; fourteen years Old. The Girls all
dress in White, &amp; are remarkably genteel. They have been educated
in the City Williamsburg in this Colony&mdash;The two eldest are now
learning Music, one to play the Harpsichord; the other the Guittar,
in the practice of which they spend three Days in the Week&mdash;I have
only further to acquaint you that every one is now speaking of the
approaching Christmas.&mdash;The young Ladies tell me we are to have a
Ball, of selected Friends in this Family&mdash;But I, hard Lot, I have never
learn'd to dance!</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 22.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Cunningham</i> came last Evening and staid the Night.&mdash;There is
a Report that he is making suit to Miss <i>Jenny Corbin</i>.</p>

<p>To day I finished my Sermon for the Presbitery&mdash;I read <i>Pictete</i>, The
<i>Spectator</i>, <i>Salust</i>, <i>History of England</i>, <i>English Grammar</i>, <i>Arithmetic</i>,
and the <i>Magazines</i> by turns. Miss <i>Priscilla</i>, and Miss <i>Nancy</i> rode this
morning in the Chariot over to Mr <i>Turburvills</i>&mdash;Bob, every day at
twelve o-Clock, is down by the River Side with his Gun after Ducks,
Gulls &amp;c.&mdash;Ben is on his Horse a Riding, Harry, is either in the
Kitchen, or at the Blacksmiths, or Carpenters Shop. They all find
places of Rendesvous so soon as the Beell rings, and all seem to choose
different Sports!&mdash;To day dined with us Mr Cox the Gentleman at
whose House I breakfasted the Day after I came first.&mdash;Evening Mr
Carter spent in playing on the Harmonica; It is the first time I have
heard the Instrument. The music is charming! He play'd, Water
parted from the Sea.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>&mdash;The Notes are clear and inexpressibly
Soft, they swell, and are inexpressibly grand; &amp; either it is because
the sounds are new, and therefore please me, or it is the most captivating
Instrument I have Ever heard. The sounds very much resemble
the human voice, and in my opinion they far exceed even the swelling
Organ.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 23.</i></p>

<p>Rose at eight&mdash;Rains this morning, the weather is also warmer.
Mr Carter has sent his son Ben to his head <i>Overseer</i>, to take notice
and account of the measuring the Crop of Corn&mdash;For the Planters
now have just gathered in their Summers Crop!&mdash;To Day I write a
letter to <i>Laura</i>: Waft it, kind Oppertunity, soon to the dear Maid,
and Make it easy, &amp; desirable for her to make me a Return!&mdash;</p>

<p>At Dinner Mr &amp; Mrs <i>Carter</i> gave their opinion concerning what
they thought pleasing and agreeable in a person; Mrs Carter said she
loved a sociable open, chatty person; that She could not bear Sullenness,
and stupidity&mdash;Mr Carter, on the other-hand, observed that it
is just which Solomon says, that there is a "time for all things under
the Sun"; that it discovers great Judgment to laugh in Season, and
that, on the whole, he is pleased with Taciturnity&mdash;pray which of
the two should I suit?&mdash;It is a custom with our <i>Bob</i> whenever he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
can coax his <i>Dog</i> up stairs, to take him into his Bed, and make him a
companion; I was much pleased this morning while he and <i>Harry</i>
were reading in Course a Chapter in the Bible, that they read in the
27th Chapter of Deuteronomy the Curses threatened there for
Crimes; Bob seldom, perhaps never before, read the verse, at last read
that "Cursed be he that lyeth with any manner of Beast, and all the
People shall say Amen." I was exceedingly Pleased, yet astonished at
the Boy on two accounts.&mdash;1st At the end of every verse, befor he
came to this, he would pronounce aloud, "Amen." But on Reading
this verse he not only omitted the "Amen," but seem'd visibly struck
with confusion!&mdash;2d And so soon as the Verse was read, to excuse
himself, he said at once, Brother <i>Ben</i> slept all last winter with his
Dog, and learn'd me!&mdash;Thus ready are Mankind always to evade
Correction!&mdash;This Evening, after I had dismiss'd the Children, &amp;
was sitting in the School-Room cracking Nuts, none present but Mr
<i>Carters Clerk</i>, a civil, inoffensive, agreeable young Man, who acts
both in the character of a Clerk and Steward, when the Woman who
makes my Bed, asked me for the key of my Room, and on seeing the
young Man sitting with me, she told him that her Mistress had this
afternoon given orders that their Allowance of Meat should be given
out to them to-morrow.&mdash;She left us; I then asked the young man
what their allowance is? He told me that excepting some favourites
about the table, their weekly allowance is a peck of Corn, &amp; a pound
of Meat a Head!&mdash;And Mr Carter is allow'd by all, &amp; from what I
have already seen of others, I make no Doubt at all but he is, by far
the most humane to his Slaves of any in these parts! Good God! are
these Christians?&mdash;When I am on the Subject, I will relate further,
what I heard Mr George Lees Overseer, one Morgan, say the other
day that he himself had often done to Negroes, and found it useful;
He said that whipping of any kind does them no good, for they will
laugh at your greatest Severity; But he told us he had invented two
things, and by several experiments had proved their success.&mdash;For
Sulleness, Obstinacy, or Idleness, says he, Take a Negro, strip him,
tie him fast to a post; take then a sharp Curry-Comb, &amp; curry him
severely til he is well scrap'd; &amp; call a Boy with some dry Hay, and
make the Boy rub him down for several Minutes, then salt him, &amp;
unlose him. He will attend to his Business, (said the inhuman Infidel)
afterwards!&mdash;But savage Cruelty does not exceed His next diabolical
Invention&mdash;To get a Secret from a Negro, says he, take the following
Method&mdash;Lay upon your Floor a large thick plank, having a peg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
about eighteen Inches long, of hard wood, &amp; very Sharp, on the
upper end, fixed fast in the plank&mdash;then strip the Negro, tie the Cord
to a staple in the Ceiling, so as that his foot may just rest on the
sharpened Peg, then turn him briskly round, and you would laugh
(said our informer) at the Dexterity of the Negro, while he was releiving
his Feet on the sharpen'd Peg!&mdash;I need say nothing of these
seeing there is a righteous God, who will take vengeance on such Inventions!&mdash;Miss
<i>Priscilla</i> and <i>Nancy</i> returned in the evening.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 24.</i></p>

<p>Ben Rode off this morning before day to Mr Fantleroys, for Christmas
I dismiss'd the children while next Wednesday. I was introduced
by Mr Carter at Dinner, to Dr Jones<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> a practitioner in Richmond. I
spent my Day in my Room alone as agreeably as I have done any
since I have been in virginia coppying off my Sermon, &amp; correcting
it. Retirement is as pleasing, &amp; desirable to me here as at <i>princeton</i>, or
<i>Cohansie!</i> &amp; by Gods blessing I hope to make it as profitable. In the
Evening I read the two first Books of <i>popes Homer</i>. Dr Jones supped
with us, &amp; is to stay the Night. The conversation at supper was on
Nursing Children; I find it is common here for people of Fortune to
have their young Children suckled by the Negroes! Dr Jones told us
his first and only Child is now with such a Nurse; &amp; Mrs Carter said
that Wenches have suckled several of hers&mdash;Mrs Carter has had
thirteen Children She told us to night and she has nine now living; of
which seven are with me. Guns are fired this Evening in the Neighbourhood,
and the Negroes seem to be inspired with new Life.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
The Day has been serene and mild, but the Evening is hazy.</p>

<p>Supp'd on Oysters.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 25.</i></p>

<p>I was waked this morning by Guns fired all round the House. The
morning is stormy, the wind at South East rains hard Nelson the Boy
who makes my Fire, blacks my shoes, does errands &amp;c. was early in
my Room, drest only in his shirt and Breeches! He made me a vast
fire, blacked my Shoes, set my Room in order, and wish'd me a joyful
Christmas, for which I gave him half a Bit.&mdash;Soon after he left the
Room, and before I was Drest, the Fellow who makes the Fire in our
School Room, drest very neatly in green, but almost drunk, entered
my chamber with three or four profound Bows, &amp; made me the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
salutation; I gave him a <i>Bit</i>, and dismissed him as soon as possible.&mdash;Soon
after my Cloths and Linen were sent in with a message for a
Christmas <i>Box</i>, as they call it; I sent the poor Slave a Bit, &amp; my thanks.&mdash;I
was obliged for want of small change, to put off for some days
the Barber who shaves &amp; dresses me.&mdash;I gave <i>Tom</i> the Coachman,
who Doctors my Horse, for his care two Bits, &amp; am to give more
when the Horse is well.&mdash;I gave to <i>Dennis</i> the Boy who waits at Table
half a <i>Bit</i>&mdash;So that the sum of my Donations to the Servants, for this
Christmas appears to be five Bits, a Bit is a pisterene bisected; or an
English sixpence, &amp; passes here for seven pence Halfpenny, the whole
is <i>3s 1d.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>At Breakfast, when Mr Carter entered the Room, he gave us the
compliments of the Season. He told me, very civily, that as my Horse
was Lame, his own riding Horse is at my Service to ride when &amp;
where I Choose.</p>

<p>Mrs Carter was, as always, cheerful, chatty, &amp; agreeable; She told
me after Breakfast several droll, merry Occurrences that happened
while she was in the City Williamsburg.&mdash;</p>

<p>This morning came from the Post-office at Hobbes-Hole, on the
Rappahannock, our News-papers. Mr Carter takes the Pennsylvania
Gazette, which seems vastly agreeable to me, for it is like having
something from home&mdash;But I have yet no answer to my Letter. We
dined at four o-Clock&mdash;Mr Carter kept in his Room, because he
breakfasted late, and on Oysters&mdash;There were at Table Mrs Carter
&amp; her five Daughters that are at School with me&mdash;Miss <i>Priscilla</i>,
<i>Nancy</i>, <i>Fanny</i>, <i>Betsy</i>, and <i>Harriot</i>, five as beautiful delicate, well-instructed
Children as I have ever known!&mdash;<i>Ben</i> is abroad; <i>Bob</i> &amp;
<i>Harry</i> are out; so there was no Man at Table but myself.&mdash;I must
carve&mdash;Drink the Health&mdash;and talk if I can! Our Dinner was no
otherwise than common, yet as elegant a <i>Christmas Dinner</i> as I ever
sat Down to&mdash;The table Discourse was Marriage; Mrs <i>Carter</i> observ'd
that was she a Widow, she should scruple to marry any man alive;
She gave a reason, that She did not think it probable a man could love
her grown old when the world is thronged with blooming, ripening
Virgins; but in fact Mrs Carter looks &amp; would pass for a younger
Woman than some unmarried Ladies of my acquaintance, who
would willingly enough make us place them below twenty!&mdash;We
dined at four; when we rose from table it was growing dark&mdash;The
wind continues at South East &amp; is stormy and muddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Mr <i>Randolph</i> the Clerk told me this Evening a Circumstance concerning
<i>Bob</i> which tho it discovered stupidity, yet at the same time
discovered great thoughtfulness.&mdash;It was about his sleeping with the
<i>Dog</i>; Mr <i>Randolph</i> told me <i>Bob</i> asked him with great solemnity if
he thought <i>God Almighty</i> knew it!&mdash;While we supped Mr <i>Carter</i>
as he often does played on the <i>Forte-Piano</i>. He almost never sups.
Last Night and to night I had large clear, &amp; very elegant Spermaceti
Candles sent into my Room;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 26.</i></p>

<p>I rose at eight&mdash;The morning is fair; all seem quiet&mdash;I went to the
window before I was drest, having only a Gown thrown about me
&amp; enjoy'd a beautiful Prospect of the high Banks of the River Nomini
gilded by the morning Sun&mdash;I could not help casting my Eyes with
eagerness over the blue Potowmack and look homewards.&mdash;After
having paid my morning secret Devotion to the King of Kings, I sat
myself to the correcting and transcribing my Sermon&mdash;I had the
pleasure to wait on Mrs <i>Carter</i> to Church She rode in the Chariot, &amp;
Miss Prissy and Nancy; Mr Carter chose to stay at Home&mdash;The
Sacrament was to have been administred but there was so few people
that he thought it improper, and put of til Sunday fortnight. He
preach'd from Isaiah 9.6. For unto us a child is Born &amp;c. his Sermon
was fifteen Minutes long! very fashionable&mdash;He invited me very
civilly to Dine &amp; spend the Evening with him, but I could not leave
the Ladies! He made me almost promise, however to call some Day
this Week.</p>

<p>At the Church to day I heard an impious Expression from a young
Scotch-Man,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Tutor in Mr Washingtons Family; he meant it for a
Satire upon the neglect of the people in suffering their Grave Yard to
lie common&mdash;He saw some Cattle &amp; Hogs feeding &amp; rooting in the
yard; "Why, says he, if I was buried here it would grieve me to look
up and see <i>Swine</i> feeding over me"!&mdash;But I understand only the
lower sort of People are buried at the Church; for the Gentleman
have private burying-Yards.</p>


<p><i>Monday 27.</i></p>

<p>At Breakfast Mrs Carter gave me an Invitation to wait on her to
Parson <i>Smiths</i> Mr Carter offered Me his riding Horse, A beautiful
grey, young, lively Colt; We sat out about ten, Mrs Carter, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Prissy, Miss Fanny, &amp; Miss Betsy, in the Chariot; Bob and I were on
Horse back; Mrs Carter had three waiting Men; a Coachman. Driver
&amp; Postillion. We found the way muddy; got there a little after twelve;
Mr Smith was out; I was introduced by Mrs Carter to Mrs Smith,
and a young Lady her Sister who lives with them; At Dinner I was
at Mr Smiths request to "say Grace" as they call it; which is always
express'd by the People in the following words, "God bless us in
what we are to receive"&mdash;&amp; after Dinner, "God make us thankful for
his mercies"&mdash;As we were sitting down to Table Ben Carter rode up;
when we had dined, the Ladies retired, leaving us a Bottle of Wine,
&amp; a Bowl of Toddy for companions&mdash;Ben came with a Message for
me to go to a Ball, but poor fellow, I cant dance!&mdash;He prest me very
much, but I was forced to decline it&mdash;We returned in the Evening; &amp;
found Mr Carter &amp; Miss Nancy practising Music, one on the Forte-Piano,
and the other on the Guitar. Mr Carter is Learning Bedford,
Coles hill, and several other Church Tunes.</p>

<p><i>Teusday 28.</i></p>

<p>Last Night there fell a Snow, which is about half Shoe deep, the
Air is sharp, the wind at North, &amp; Snows yet by turns. I finished and
laid by my Sermon for the Presbytery this morning&mdash;Breakfasted at
ten: Ben staid last Night at Mr <i>Turbuville's</i> &amp; got Home to day about
twelve from his <i>Christmas Jaunt</i>.</p>

<p>Spent most of the Day at the great House hearing the various Instruments
of Music. Evening, at Miss Prissy's Request I drew for her
some Flowers on Linen which she is going to imbroider, for a various
Counterpane.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><i>Wednesday 29.</i></p>

<p>This Morning our School begins after the Holidays. Bob seems
sorry that he must forsake the Marsh &amp; River when he is daily
fowling, &amp; never kills any Game. At Dinner we had the Company of
Dr Franks<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> who has been all along Mr Carters Clerk; but is now
leaving Him. We had a large Pye cut to Day to signify the Conclusion
of the Holidays. I drew, this afternoon more Flowers for Miss
Prissy.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 30.</i></p>

<p>Dr Franks is moving, he has lived in the House adjoining our School.
The morning is fine, I rose by eight, breakfasted at ten, Miss Prissy
&amp; Nancy are to-Day Practising Music one on the Forte Piano, the
other on the Guitar, their Papa allows them for that purpose every
Teusday, &amp; Thursday. Ben is gone to the Quarter to see to the measuring
the crop of Corn. On his return in the Evening, when we were
sitting &amp; chatting, among other things he told me that we must have
a House-warming, seeing we have now got possession of the whole
House&mdash;It is a custom here whenever any <i>person</i> or <i>Family</i> move into
a <i>House</i>, or repair a house they have been living in before, they make
a <i>Ball</i> &amp; give a Supper&mdash;So we because we have gotten Possession of
the whole House, are in compliance with Custom, to invite our
Neighbours, and dance, and be merry&mdash;But poor me! I must hobble,
or set quiet in the Corner!</p>


<p><i>Fryday 31.</i></p>

<p>I rose at eight. <i>Ben</i> gone again to the quarter&mdash;<i>Harriot</i> to Day for
the first time said all her letters&mdash;</p>

<p>The Colonel shewed me after Dinner a new invention, which is to
be sure his own, for tuning his <i>Harpischord</i> &amp; <i>Forte-Piano</i>: it is a
number of <i>Whistles</i>, of various Sizes so as to sound all the Notes in
one Octave. At twelve o-Clock Mr <i>Carter</i> ordered his Boy to bring
two Horses, and himself &amp; Miss <i>Prissy</i> rode out for an airing as the
Day is vastly fine&mdash;Assoon as the Bell rang &amp; I had dismissed the Children
I took a walk in the Garden; When I had gone round two or
three Platts Mrs Carter entered and walked towards me, I then immediately
turn'd and met Her; I bowed&mdash;Remarked on the pleasantness
of the Day&mdash;And began to ask her some questions upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Row of small slips&mdash;To all which she made polite and full answers;
As we walked along she would move the Ground at the Root of some
plant; or prop up with small sticks the bended <i>scions</i>&mdash;We took two
whole turns through all the several Walks, &amp; had such conversation
as the <i>Place</i> and <i>Objects</i> naturally excited&mdash;And after Mrs Carter had
given some orders to the Gardiners (for there are two Negroes
Gardiners by Trade, who are constantly when the Weather will any
how permit working in it) we walked out into the <i>Area</i> viewed some
Plumb-Trees, when we saw Mr Carter and Miss Prissy returning&mdash;We
then repaired to the Slope before the front-Door where they dismounted&mdash;and
we all went into the Dining Room. I shall in a proper
time describe the great-House, &amp; the several smaller ones in its neighbourhood;
the <i>Area</i>, <i>Poplar-Walk</i>, <i>Garden</i>, &amp; <i>Pasture</i>: In the mean
time I shall only say, they discover a delicate and Just Tast, and are
the effect of great <i>Invention</i> &amp; <i>Industry,</i> &amp; <i>Expence</i>. At Dinner we
were conversing on the seasons of the Year, &amp; giving our different
opinions of which of the Seasons we each thought most agreeable:
Mrs Carter chose the Months of October, November &amp; December,
her reasons were, that we are always most sensible of pleasure when
it succeeds Axiety &amp; Pain; therefore because these months immediately
follow those in which there is usually Thunder &amp; Lightning &amp;
intense Heat, She thinks them most pleasant: The Colonel agreed
with her as to the Months but gave a different Reason; He supposes
that in these Months the Air is more uniform and settled than at any
other so long time in the year. I preferr'd May, June, and July, because
our Bodies at that Season are generally sprightly, vigorous and
healthy, and the world around us is beautiful &amp; growing to necessary
perfection. Miss Prissy &amp; Miss Nancy were on my side.</p>

<p>Mrs Carter told the Colonel that he must not think her setled (for
they have been for a long time from this place in the City <i>Williamsburg</i>,
and only left it about a year and a half ago) till he made her a
park and stock'd it; while these and many other things were saying,
I was surprized at a Remark which Miss <i>Prissy</i> made, "Why Mama
says she, you plan and talk of these things as tho' you should never
die"!</p>


<p><i>Saturday January 1. 1774.</i></p>

<p>Another Year is gone! Last New years Day I had not the most
remote expectation of being now here in <i>Virginia</i>! Perhaps by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
next I shall have made a longer and more important Remove, from
this to the World of Spirits!</p>

<p>It is well worth the while, for the better improving of our time to
come to recollect and reflect upon the Time which we have spent;
The Season seems to require it; it will give entertainment at least,
perhaps much substantial pleasure too, to be able to make with a considerable
degree of certainty a review of the general course of our
Actions in the course of a year. This shall be my employment, so far
as I am able to recollect, when I shall have suitable time for the fixing
&amp; laying my thoughts together&mdash;</p>

<p>In the mean time I observe that the Day is most pleasant, the wind
is West, not fresh; the air is void of clouds, but near the Earth is
smoky; the Ground is clear of Frost and setled, what can be finer?
Mr Carter Miss Prissy and myself were to have rode out for an Exercise
at twelve, but we were prevented by the coming of a Gentleman,
Dr <i>Fantleroy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> to whom Mr Carter introduced me&mdash;</p>

<p>After Dinner was finished which was about four o-Clock, Miss
Prissy &amp; Myself, together with a Servant (for Mr Carter would not
trust us alone he said) rode on Horse-Back to Mr Turbuvilles, about
three quarters of a Mile distance; It is the first time I have been there,
the House is near, &amp; in Sight, and the families intimate. I rode my
Horse for the first time since his misfortune. When we returned
about Candlelight, we found Mrs Carter in the yard seeing to the
Roosting of her Poultry; and the Colonel in the Parlour tuning his
<i>Guitar</i>.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 2.</i></p>

<p>The weather warm and Damp&mdash;The Family rode to Church to-day
and are to dine out. Mr Carter at my request, gave me the Keys
of his Book-Cases and allowed me to spend the Day alone in his
Library.</p>

<p>The place seems suitable for Study, &amp; the Day ought to be spent
in serious contemplation; therefore, as I proposed Yesterday, I shall
collect together and write down what I have been doing in the last
Year. But will my Life bear the review? Can I look upon my Actions
and not Blush! And shall I be no less careful, or have no better Success,
in the prosecution of my Duty the Year to come, if I shall be
kept alive to the Close of it?&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Beginning of the last year I was in Deerfield, in Cumberland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
County New-Jersey, with the Rev'd Mr Green; Under him I studied
the Hebrew-Language and Divinity. I left the college the last of September
1772. After having setled my business at Home, I entered
upon the Study of Divinity with the Rev'd Andrew Hunter; I was
with him about a Month, and on the first of December I went to Mr
<i>Green</i> with a design to acquaint myself with the Hebrew Tongue;
he put me to the Grammar, which I learn'd through, and read some
Chapters in the Psalter in the Course of the Winter: In Divinity, he
advised me to read Ridgeleys body of Divinity for a System: And
he gave me several separate treatisses on Repentance, Regeneration,
Faith, &amp;c., &amp; towards spring gave me subjects to consider in the Sermon-Way.
Yet how barren am I still? It is an arduous task to bring
the Mind to close application; &amp; still greater to lay up and retain useful
Knowledge. I continued with Mr <i>Green</i> &amp; pursued my studies, I
hope with some Success till August 1773. when I was solicited by Dr
<i>Witherspoon</i> to go into <i>Virginia</i> &amp; teach in a Gentlemans Family&mdash;The
Offer seem'd profitable; I was encouraged by the Dr and was to
have his Recommendation&mdash;I had likewise myself a strong inclination
to go&mdash;Yet I was in great Doubt, &amp; Wholly undetermined for some
Weeks, because many of my friends, and some of my near Relations
opposed my leaving Home, and all seem'd utterly unwilling to advise
to go&mdash;It is time, according to the Course of my Life they said that
I was settling to some constant Employment, and they told me I
ought especially to enter with as great speed as convenient into that
plan of Life for which I have in particular had my Education&mdash;That
Virginia is sickly&mdash;That the People there are profane, and exceeding
wicked&mdash;That I shall read there no Calvinistic Books, nor hear any
Presbyterian Sermons&mdash;That I must keep much Company, and therefore
spend as much, very probably much more Money than my
Salary&mdash;These considerations unsettled for a while my mind&mdash;On
the other hand I proposed to myself the following advantages by
going&mdash;A longer opportunity for Study than my friends would willingly
allow me If I should remain at home&mdash;A more general acquaintance
with the manners of Mankind; and a better Knowledge of the
Soil, &amp; Commerce of these neighbouring Provinces&mdash;And a more
perfect acquaintance with the Doctrines, &amp; method of Worship in
the established Church in these Colonies, &amp; especially with the Conduct
of the Clergy of which there have been so many bad reports&mdash;All
these however when I had laid them together, seem'd to overbear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the others, so that I determined at last to break through and go!&mdash;Here
now I am in a strange Province; But I am under no more nor
stronger temptations to any kind of vice, perhaps not so great as at
Cohansie,&mdash;unless sometimes when I am solicited to dance I am forc'd
to blush, for my Inability&mdash;I have the opportunity of living with
Credit perfectly retired&mdash;in a well regulated family&mdash;With a man
of Sense&mdash;May God help me to walk in his fear &amp; Gloryfy his
Name!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Monday 3d.</i></p>

<p>Last Evening, by Miss Prissy, I was complimented with an Invitation
from Mr <i>Turburville</i> to Dine with Him tomorrow&mdash;Squire <i>Lee</i><a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> is
as Miss Prissy told me, preparing to make a splendid <i>Ball</i>, which is to
last four or five Days; we are to be invited!&mdash;But I must stay at Home
and read <i>Salust</i>&mdash;Mr Carter is at Richmond-Court, which is held
monthly here in every County. In the Evening Mr Warden, a young
Scotch Lawyer came home with him. I spent the Evening in the
Parlour&mdash;After Supper when I was call'd upon for my Tost I mentioned
with Pleasure Miss <i>Betsy Beaty</i>.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 4.</i></p>

<p>Rose by eight&mdash;Mr <i>Warden</i> breakfasted with us. Miss Prissy befor
Breakfast, as it is her practising Day, gave us sundry Tunes on the
<i>Forte Piano</i>. I kept the children while twelve then as we were to dine
out, I dismiss'd them till morning, and prepar'd to ride&mdash;Mrs Carter,
Miss Sylla, and Miss Betsy rode in the Chariot, and set off about half
after twelve with three waiting men&mdash;Mr Carter, Ben, and myself,
waited, &amp; left Home by half after one, we rode on Horse back, and
waited on ourselves&mdash;It was two o-Clock when we got to Mr Turburvilles
where we were to dine&mdash;We found there two Gentlemen, with
their Wives, and one of them had also a Son &amp; Daughter Mr Booth
also came in a short time after us; So that there dined to day with
Mr Turburville to day besides his usual Family thirteen Persons.&mdash;And
if I mention the Waiting Men With the Carriages they were
twenty. We had an Elegant Dinner, but it did not in any thing
exceed what is every day at Mr <i>Carters</i> Table.</p>

<p>&mdash;We all returned Home before Dark&mdash;In the Evening the Colonel is
busy in transposing Music, I have not been at any house since I left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Home, which, from the appearance of its Situation, and the Economy
of the Family, or any other apparent Convenience, I would so soon
choose to reside in as a tutor, as the one in which it is my lot to be
placed&mdash;The Family is most agreeable! Mr Carter is sensible judicious,
much given to retirement &amp; Study; his Company, &amp; conversation
are always profitable&mdash;His main Studies are <i>Law</i> &amp; <i>Music</i>, the
latter of which seems to be his darling Amusement&mdash;It seems to
nourish, as well as entertain his mind! And to be sure he has a nice
well judging Ear, and has made great advances in the Theory and
Practice of music&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <i>Carter</i> is prudent, always cheerful, never without Something
pleasant, a remarkable Economist, perfectly acquainted (in my Opinion)
with the good-management of Children, intirely free from all
foolish and unnecessary fondness, and is also well acquainted (for
She has always been used) with the formality and Ceremony which
we find commonly in high Life&mdash;Ben, the eldest, is a youth of genius:
of a warm impetuous Disposition; desirous of acquiring Knowledge,
docile, vastly inquisitive &amp; curious in mercantile, and mechanical
Matters, is very fond of Horsses, and takes great pleasure in exercising
them&mdash;Bob, the other Brother, is By no means destitute of capacity,
As Mr Marshal who was his last Tutor has asserted, &amp; as many now
suppose: He is extremely volatile &amp; unsettled in his temper, which
makes it almost wholly impossible to fix him for any time to the same
thing&mdash;On which account he has made but very little advancement
in any one Branch of Study, and this is attributed to Barrenness of
Genius&mdash;He is slovenly, clumsy, very fond of Shooting, of Dogs, of
Horses, But a very stiff untoward <i>Rider</i>, good natur'd, pleased with
the Society of persons much below his Family, and Estate, and tho'
quick and wrathful in his temper, yet he is soon moderated, &amp; easily
subdued&mdash;Harry the Nephew, is rather stoical, sullen, or saturnine in
his make. He is obstinate, tho' Steady, and makes a slow uniform advance
in his Learning, he is vastly kind to me, but in particular to my
Horse, of his health or Indisposition&mdash;Miss <i>Priscilla</i>, the eldest Daughter
about 16, is steady, studious, docile, quick of apprehension, and
makes good progress in what She undertakes; If I could with propriety
continue in the Family, I should require no stronger Inducement
than the Satisfaction I should receive by seeing this young Lady
become perfectly acquainted with any thing I propose so soon as I
communicate it to her, but the situation of my affairs makes it out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
my power to stay longer than a year; She is small of her age, has a
mild winning Presence, a sweet obliging Temper, never swears, which
is here a distinguished virtue, dances finely, plays well on key'd Instruments,
and is upon the whole in the first Class of the female Sex.</p>

<p><i>Nancy</i> the Second, is not without some few of those qualities which
are by some (I think with great ill nature, and with little or no truth)
said to belong intirely to the fair Sex. I mean great curiosity, Eagerness
for superiority, Ardor in friend ship, But bitterness and rage
where there is enmity&mdash;She is not constant in her disposition, nor
diligent nor attentive to her business&mdash;But She has her excellencies,
She is cheerful, tender in her Temper, easily managed by perswasion
&amp; is never without what seems to have been a common Gift of
Heaven, to the <i>fair-Sex</i>, the "<i>Copia Verborum</i>," or readiness of Expression!&mdash;She
is only beginning to play the <i>Guitar</i>, She understands
the Notes well, &amp; is a graceful Dancer.</p>

<p><i>Fanny</i> next, is in her Person, according to my Judgment, the
Flower in the Family&mdash;She has a strong resemblance of her <i>Mama</i>
who is an elegant, beautiful Woman&mdash;Miss Fanny seems to have a
remarkable Sedateness, &amp; simplicity in her countenance, which is
always rather chearful than melancholy; She has nothing with which
we can find Fault in her Person, but has something in the Features
of her Face which insensibly pleases us, &amp; always when She is in Sight
draws our Attention, &amp; much the more because there seems to be for
every agreeable Feature a correspondent Action which improves &amp;
adorns it. Betsy next is young, quiet, and obedient&mdash;Harriot is bold,
fearless, noisy and lawless; always merry, almost never displeased;
She seems to have a Heart easily moved by the force of Music; She
has learned many Tunes &amp; can strike any Note, or Succession of
Notes perfectly with the Flute or Harpsichord, and is never wearied
with the sound of Music either vocal or <i>Instrumental</i>.</p>

<p>These are the Persons who are at present under my direction, &amp;
whose general Character I have very imperfectly attempted to describe.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 5.</i></p>

<p>Rose at Seven. The morning very stormy. <i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Nancy</i> before
Breakfast had a quarrel&mdash;Bob called Nancy a Lyar; Nancy upbraided
Bob, on the other Hand, with being often flog'd by their Pappa;
often by the Masters in College; that he had stol'n Rum, &amp; had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
drunk; &amp; that he used to run away &amp;c&mdash;These Reproaches when they
were set off with Miss Nancys truely feminine address, so violently
exasperated <i>Bob</i> that he struck her in his Rage&mdash;I was at the time in
my Chamber; when I enter'd the Room each began with loud and
heavy complaints, I put them off however with sharp admonitions
for better Behaviour.</p>

<p>The morning was so extremely stormy that I declin'd going to
Breakfast&mdash;All the others went my Breakfast was sent over&mdash;Immediately
after Breakfast Ben came over with a Message from Mr
<i>Carter</i>, that he desired me to correct <i>Bob</i> severely immediately&mdash;Bob
when I went into School sat quiet in the corner, &amp; looked sullen, and
penitent; I gave some orders to the Children, and went to my Room.&mdash;I
sent for Bob&mdash;He came crying&mdash;I told him his Fathers Message;
he confess'd himself guilty&mdash;I sent him to call up <i>Harry</i>&mdash;He came&mdash;I
talked with them both a long Time recommended Diligence, &amp;
good Behaviour, but concluded by observing that I was obliged to
comply with Mr Carter's request; I sent <i>Harry</i> therefore for some
Whips.&mdash;<i>Bob</i> and poor I remained trembling in the chamber (for
Bob was not more uneasy than I it being the first attempt of the kind
I have ever made)&mdash;The Whips came!&mdash;I ordered Bob to strip!&mdash;He
desired me to whip Him in his hand in Tears&mdash;I told him no&mdash;He
then patiently, &amp; with great deliberation took of his Coat and laid it
by&mdash;I took him by the hand and gave him four or five smart twigs;
he cring'd, &amp; bawld &amp; promis'd&mdash;I repeated then about eight more, &amp;
demanded and got immediately his solemn promise for peace among
the children, &amp; Good Behaviour in general&mdash;I then sent him down&mdash;He
conducts himself through this day with great Humility, &amp; unusual
diligence, it will be fine if it continues. At noon I went over to Dinner,
but it was storming, &amp; continues so bad that I choose rather to go
without Supper than venture out in the Storm.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 6.</i></p>

<p>To Day about twelve <i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Prissy</i> &amp; <i>Nancy</i> went in the Chariot to
Stratford, to attend the Dancing-School&mdash;Mr Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> the Colonels
principal Overseer dined with us&mdash;After School in the Evening, I sat
with <i>Betsy</i> &amp; <i>Fanny</i> while they sung me many songs, When they had
done I waited on them Home, &amp; spent the Evening with Mr &amp; Mrs
<i>Carter</i>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><i>Fryday 7.</i></p>

<p>The morning cold, muddy and drisly&mdash;Our School seems still, and
vacant. <i>Betsy</i> &amp; <i>Fanny</i> at their Leisure are constantly knitting with
small smoth stiff straws, in imitation of their Sister <i>Sylla</i>, who knits
sometimes. The Colonel told me last Evening that he proposes to
make the vacant End of our School-Room, Where Dr Frank lived a
Concert-Room, to hold all his instruments of Music&mdash;As he proposes
to bring up from <i>Williamsburg</i> his <i>Organ</i>, &amp; to remove the <i>Harpsichord</i>,
<i>Harmonica</i>, <i>Forte-piano</i>, <i>Guittar</i>, <i>Violin</i>, &amp; <i>German-Flutes</i>,
&amp; make it a place for Practice, as well as Entertainment.</p>

<p>This afternoon <i>Dennis</i>, a Boy of about twelve Years old, one of
the Waiters at Table, as he was standing in the front Door which is
vastly huge &amp; heavy; the Door flew up, and drew off the Skin &amp;
Flesh from his middle Finger caught between, took off the first Joint,
and left the Bone of the greater part of the Rest of the Finger naked.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 8.</i></p>

<p>Catechised the Children, and dismiss'd them about ten. The morning
pleasant&mdash;Rode before Dinner to Mr Blains Store&mdash;Was introduced
to Dr <i>Thompson</i>,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Mr <i>Balantine</i>,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Mr <i>Carr</i> a young Scotch-Man
Clerk, to Mr Blain; dined with Mr Blain. Parson <i>Smith</i>, his Wife, &amp;
her Sister were there&mdash;Colonel Washington, his Wife, &amp; their Daughter
Miss Jenny a young Lady of few words, a sanguine Countenance,
and as to her Size, something below what Ladies call elegant; neat but
not <i>flashy</i> in her Dress; Some of her Dress I admired because I have
seen <i>Laura</i> in the like, yit strongly shewed me that it is not Dress
alone I admire in Her. All these had been at a Widding in the country
and were returning&mdash;In Dr <i>Thomsons</i> Room there was hanging
against the Wall a Skeleton!&mdash;Balantine, either to shew himself a true
full-blooded Buck, or out of mere wantonness &amp; pastime turned the
Bones (as they were fixed together with Wires) into many improper
and indecent postures; but this officious industry met with such reception
from the company as it Justly merited, and as I wish'd might
happen; for they gave visible signs of their contempt of his Behaviour&mdash;About
Six in the Evening the Chariot returned with <i>Bob</i>, Miss
<i>Prissy</i> &amp; <i>Nancy</i> from the Dance at <i>Stratford</i>&mdash;They brought News
as follows: Miss Prissy told us, that they had an elegant Dance on the
Whole; that Colonel Philip Lee, where they met to Dance, was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Fryday, at the Wedding of which I made mention Just now; that Mr
<i>Christian</i> the Master danced several Minuets, prodigiously beautiful;
that Captain Grigg (Captain of an English Ship) danced a Minuet
with her; that he hobled most dolefully, &amp; that the whole Assembly
laughed!&mdash;<i>Bob</i> told us that there was a Race between Mr &mdash;&mdash; And
Colonels Horses&mdash;that they run a Mile, &amp; that <i>Dottrell</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> belonging
to Mr &mdash;&mdash; won the Race;&mdash;<i>Bob</i> told me in private, after we were
alone in my Room, that Colonel Lee took an Opportunity, &amp; asked
him in the Hearing of a large company at Supper, what sort of <i>Fellow</i>
he is whom your <i>Papa</i> had provided for your <i>Tutor</i>&mdash;<i>Bob</i> told me
that for answer he Informed him I was good and agreeable&mdash;That
Miss Jenny Corbin, (a young Lady with whom I have had the greatest
Opportunity of being acquainted, of any young Lady in Virginia)
gave him so favourable an Account of my Behaviour, that he was
pleased to say He should be glad to see me at his House, &amp; of my company&mdash;But
after having heard this much, I shall esteem myself
pardonable, &amp; shall always think it proper to refuse without thanks
his warmest Invitations; &amp; will plead for my excuse nothing else than
mere inclination.</p>

<p>In the Evening about seven o-Clock it snowed exceeding fast til<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Eight when it ceased, it being the second Snow we had this winter
here, At Supper we had much conversation about the Dance.
Mrs Carter &amp; myself, sat while ten and the Colonel read philosophy.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 9.</i></p>

<p>The Morning very cold&mdash;None from our Family went to church;
<i>Bob</i> beg'd of me to let him go, I refused him; he then asked to go and
dine with Mr Turburville, I gave him no liberty.&mdash;I wrote to-Day a
letter to <i>Laura</i>, I wish it <i>speed</i> &amp; <i>Success</i>&mdash;I wrote also a letter to Mr
<i>Bryan</i> in Baltimore; Another to the Gentleman who keeps the "Fountain
Inn" in <i>Baltimore</i>; &amp; one to Dr <i>John Beaty</i>&mdash;<i>Bob</i> returned in the
Evening after having stole away and spent the day at Mr <i>Turburvill's</i>
with a Note to his Papa from Squire <i>Lee</i>, in which Mr Carter &amp; his
Family are invited to the Ball at his House on Monday the 17th Instant
But I must stay alone.</p>

<p><i>Monday 10th</i></p>

<p>The Morning very cold&mdash;Dined with us to-day Mr <i>Sanford</i> a Captain
of a Sloop which trades out of <i>Potowmack</i> to <i>Norfolk</i>&mdash;I wrote
out some Exercises for <i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Harry</i>&mdash;In the Evening the Colonel
began with a small Still to distill some Brandy from a Liquor made of
Pisimmonds. I set Ben this Evening to writing. I likewise gave
<i>Catalines</i> Speech in <i>Salust</i> to commit to memory in Latin, which he
is to pronounce Extempore. In the Evening I borrowed of <i>Ben Carter</i>
15s.&mdash;I have plenty of Money with me, but it is in Bills of Philadelphia
currency &amp; will not pass at all here.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 11.</i></p>

<p>The morning very cold&mdash;As cold I think, and the Frost seems to
be as intense &amp; powerful as I have ever known it either at Cohansie or
at Princeton. This morning I put Ben to construe some Greek, he
has yet no Testament, I gave him therefore Esops Fables in Greek,
and Latin. I also took out of the Library, and gave him to read Gordon,
upon Geography. Ben seem'd scared with his Greek Lesson, he
swore, &amp; wished for Homer that he might kick Him, as he had been
told Homer invented Greek.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 12.</i></p>

<p>I gave <i>Sam</i> Mr Carters Barber, for shaving &amp; dressing me, &amp; for
mending my Shoes, two pisterenes, which pass here for half a Crown&mdash;The
morning is serene, pleasant, but cold yet. Miss <i>Hariot</i> this
morning being over curious tasted some Mercury Mixture in Mr
<i>Randolph's</i> Room, it made her very sick; I was frighted, the family
was frighted! she puked, &amp; threw it off her Stomach, &amp; was soon
relieved&mdash;</p>

<p>I gave <i>Martha</i> who makes my Bed, for a Christmas Box, a <i>Bit</i>, which
is a pisterene cut into two equal parts&mdash;I gave to John also, who waits
at Table &amp; calls me to Supper a <i>Bit</i>. So that My whole Expence to-Day
has been <i>3/9</i>. Mrs Carter invited me to Day to go to the Ball, I
excused myself, &amp; declined it.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 13.</i></p>

<p>Mr Cunningham came before Noon to skait&mdash;At twelve we all
went down to Mr Carters Millpond&mdash;none had skaits but Mr Cunningham&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
diverted ourselves on the Ice til two, when we went up
to dinner&mdash;Immediately after Dinner Mr <i>Carter</i> Miss <i>Prissy</i> &amp; <i>Nancy</i>
rode out to Mr <i>Lanes</i>.&mdash;Mr <i>Cunningham</i> staid the Night, Prissy
play'd for us&mdash;She has since I came made great advances&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 14.</i></p>

<p>The morning very foggy, &amp; warmer&mdash;I gave to Tom the Coach-man
who cured my Horse two <i>pisterenes</i> &amp; half a <i>Bit</i>, which is two &amp;
ninepence 2/9. Mr Cunningham breakfasted with us&mdash;When I went
into School there came a complaint from Miss <i>Sally Stanhope</i><a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> of
<i>Bob</i> that he was rude, swore, &amp; quarrell'd at Breakfast, poor untoward,
unfortunate Boy he gives me great Trouble&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 15.</i></p>

<p>I rose at seven&mdash;The morning fair the ground muddy&mdash;<i>Ben</i> asked
me to ride with him to Mr Blains Store I chose rather to stay at Home&mdash;Ben
is preparing for the approaching Ball&mdash;Bob urged me to let
him go to Mr Lees, but he is so unruly &amp; mischeivous when abroad
that I was obliged to refuse him the liberty of going. I spent some
hours to Day with the Girls when they were practising Music on the
Guitar, &amp; Forte-piano, Priscilla plays her tunes true and exceeding
finely&mdash;In the Evening <i>Ben</i> returned from Mr Blains&mdash;He told me the
Store was thronged with company&mdash;Sup'd on chocolate, &amp; hoe-Cake,
so called because baked on a Hoe before the fire&mdash;The Colonel and
his Daughter busy at Music.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 16.</i></p>

<p>The morning frosty &amp; cold&mdash;<i>Ben</i>, <i>Bob</i>, <i>Harry</i>, &amp; Mr <i>Randolph</i> went
to Church&mdash;I stay at Home; Read Pictete&mdash;I feel very desirous of
seeing Home: of hearing good Mr Hunter Preach; of seeing my dear
Brothers &amp; Sister; Indeed the very soil itself would be precious to me!&mdash;I
am shut up in my chamber; I read a while, then walk to the North
window, &amp; look over Potowmack through Maryland towards Home;
then throw myself down into my Chair again &amp; console myself that
I have every necessary, &amp; convenient Accommodation here, which I
should have; nay much more than I should allow myself were I at
Home. I am contented&mdash;This whole world is only a Point almost unnoticeable,
when compared with the numerous <i>Systems</i> which compose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the <i>universe</i>, &amp; yet they all are under the particular Direction
&amp; Government of <i>Almighty God</i>; How insignificant therefore is it
for me and how foolish to be uneasy, &amp; solicitous whether I live in
<i>Cohansie</i>, in <i>Princeton</i>, or in <i>Virgininia</i>; Or in <i>America</i>, or in <i>Europe</i>,
so long as I am still supported, &amp; upheld by the Divine Agency!&mdash;I
am fully satisfied&mdash;Guide me, propitious Heaven! Help me to Glorify
my God; To honour the holy Religion which I profess; &amp; If I shall
be fitted, &amp; introduced to the Ministry, may I still go on and be of
advantage to my fellow Mortals!&mdash;</p>

<p>Evening, The Boys are returned; <i>Bob</i> brings me the <i>parsons</i> Compliments;
Mr <i>Cunninghams</i>; &amp; that Miss Corbin enquired If I was
well!&mdash;Bob [also] informed me that the <i>Parson</i>, Mr <i>Blain</i>, <i>Cunningham</i>,
<i>Balantine</i>, &amp; others are to come to Captain <i>Turburvilles</i> Mill-Pond
to Skate before they go to the Ball&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Monday 17.</i></p>

<p>At Breakfast the Colonel gave orders to the Boys concerning their
conduct this Day, &amp; through the course of the Ball&mdash;He allows them
to go; to stay all this Night; to bring him an Account of all the company
at the Ball; &amp; to return tomorrow Evening&mdash;All the morning is
spent in Dressing.&mdash;Mr Carter &amp; Mrs Carter pressed me to go; But,
mindful of my Promise when I left Home, I stay and enjoy myself in
quiet.&mdash;I give the Children a Holiday to Day&mdash;I gave Dennis the
Waiter half a Bit a Present&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i>, Miss <i>Prissy</i>, &amp; <i>Nancy</i> dressed
splendidly set away from Home at two.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 18.</i></p>

<p>Mrs <i>Carter</i>, &amp; the young Ladies came Home last Night from the
Ball, &amp; brought with them Mrs <i>Lane</i>, they tell us there were upwards
of Seventy at the Ball; forty one Ladies; that the company was
genteel; &amp; that Colonel <i>Harry Lee</i>,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> from <i>Dumfries</i>, &amp; his Son
<i>Harrey</i> who was with me at College, were also there; Mrs Carter
made this an argument, and it was a strong one indeed, that to-day I
must dress &amp; go with her to the Ball&mdash;She added also that She Desired
my Company in the Evening when she should come Home as it would
be late&mdash;After considering a while I consented to go, &amp; was dressed&mdash;we
set away from Mr Carters at two; Mrs <i>Carter</i> &amp; the young
Ladies in the Chariot, Mrs Lane in a Chair, &amp; myself on Horseback&mdash;As
soon as I had handed the Ladies out, I was saluted by Parson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<i>Smith</i>; I was introduced into a small Room where a number of
Gentlemen were playing Cards, (the first game I have seen since I
left Home) to lay off my Boots Riding-Coat &amp;c&mdash;Next I was directed
into the Dining-Room to see Young Mr <i>Lee</i>; He introduced me to
his Father&mdash;With them I conversed til Dinner, which came in at half
after four. The Ladies dined first, when some Good order was preserved;
when they rose, each nimblest Fellow dined first&mdash;The Dinner
was as elegant as could be well expected when so great an Assembly
were to be kept for so long a time.&mdash;For Drink, there was several
sorts of Wine, good Lemon Punch, Toddy, Cyder, Porter &amp;c.&mdash;About
Seven the Ladies &amp; Gentlemen begun to dance in the Ball-Room&mdash;first
Minuets one Round; Second Giggs; third Reels; And
last of All Country-Dances; tho' they struck several Marches occasionally&mdash;The
Music was a French-Horn and two Violins&mdash;The
Ladies were Dressed Gay, and splendid, &amp; when dancing, their Silks
&amp; Brocades rustled and trailed behind them!&mdash;But all did not join in
the Dance for there were parties in Rooms made up, some at Cards;
some drinking for Pleasure; some toasting the Sons of america; some
singing "Liberty Songs" as they call'd them, in which six, eight, ten
or more would put their Heads near together and roar, &amp; for the most
part as unharmonious as an affronted&mdash;Among the first of these
Vociferators was a young Scotch-Man, Mr <i>Jack Cunningham</i>; he was
nimis bibendo appotus; noisy, droll, waggish, yet civil in his way &amp;
wholly inoffensive&mdash;I was solicited to dance by several, Captain
Chelton, Colonel Lee, Harry Lee, and others; But George Lee,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> with
great Rudeness as tho' half drunk, asked me why I would come to the
Ball &amp; neither dance nor play Cards? I answered him shortly, (for
his Impudence moved my resentment) that my Invitation to the Ball
would Justify my Presence; &amp; that he was ill qualified to direct my
Behaviour who made so indifferent a Figure himself&mdash;Parson Smiths,
&amp; Parson Gibberns Wives danced, but I saw neither of the Clergymen
either dance or game<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>&mdash;At Eleven Mrs Carter call'd upon me
to go, I listned with gladness to the summons &amp; with Mrs Lane in the
Chariot we rode Home, the Evening sharp and cold!&mdash;I handed the
Ladies out, waited on them to a warm Fire, then ran over to my own
Room, which was warm and had a good Fire; oh how welcome! Better
this than to be at the Ball in some corner nodding, and awaked
now &amp; then with a midnight Yell!&mdash;In my Room by half after twelve;
&amp; exceeding happy that I could break away with Reputation.&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span><i>Wednesday 19.</i></p>

<p>Rose at Nine while the Bell was ringing&mdash;Breakfasted at ten, Mr
<i>Carter</i> and I alone, the Ladies yet in Bed&mdash;I gave the Children the
third Holiday; <i>Bob</i> <i>Ben</i> &amp; <i>Harry</i> are yet at the Dance&mdash;Mrs Carter
declines going to Day, I took a Walk out before Dinner, &amp; with my
Pen-knife carved <i>Laura's</i> much admired Name, upon a smooth beautiful
Beech-Tree&mdash;Towards Evening Mrs Lane left us &amp; rode home&mdash;<i>Bob</i>
came Home about six, but so sleepy that he is actually stupified!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 20.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> came Home late in the Night&mdash;This morning he looks fatigued
out. We began to study to Day but all seem sleepy and dull. Dined
with us to-day Mr <i>Lee</i> a Gentleman from Augusta County, who has
lately been to the Settlements on Ohio.</p>

<p>Evening I began some Verses on Miss Carter for a present at the
approaching Valantine<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>&mdash;But I drew the Picture from Laura.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 21.</i></p>

<p>All seem tolerably recruited this morning; we hear, the company left
the Ball last Evening, quite wearied out; tho' the Colonel intreated
them to stay the proposed Time.</p>

<p>To Day about twelve came to Mr <i>Carters</i> Captain <i>John Lee</i>, a Gentleman
who seems to copy the Character of <i>Addisons Will Wimble</i>.
When I was on my way to this place I saw him up in the country at
Stafford; he was then just sallying out on his Winters Visit, &amp; has
got now so far as here, he stays, as I am told about eight, or ten
Weeks in the year at his own House, the remaining part he lives with
his waiting Man on his Friends.&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 22.</i></p>

<p>Captain Lee with us to Day&mdash;The Weather cold; I set in my Room
all Day working at my Verses for Miss Carter.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 23.</i></p>

<p>None went to Church on account of the Cold&mdash;Afternoon the Sun
shone fair&mdash;I took my Horse &amp; rode about a Mile &amp; returned&mdash;Captain
<i>Lee</i> left us this Day.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><i>Monday 24.</i></p>

<p>Still very cold snows some&mdash;Dined with us Colonel <i>Frank</i> L. <i>Lee</i>,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
&amp; Colonel <i>Harrison</i> of Maryland&mdash;Miss <i>Nancy</i> unwel of a cold.&mdash;There
are great Professions of Liberty here expressed in Songs
Toasts, &amp;c. Yesterday News came of the Arrival of Ships with Tea;
into <i>Boston</i>, <i>New-york</i>, <i>Philadelphia</i>. &amp; of the New-Yorkers burning
the House of his Excellency Governor <i>Tryon</i>. for having said that, if
orders concerning the Tea had been transmitted to him he would
have landed it tho' under the mouths of the Cannon!&mdash;Gentlemen
here in general applaud &amp; honour our Northern Colonies for so
manly, &amp; patriotic Resistance!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 25.</i></p>

<p>Still sharp &amp; cold&mdash;Miss Nancy much indisposed with a sore throat&mdash;Dined
with us Mr <i>Cunningham</i>. Toasts the <i>King</i>, <i>Queen</i>, <i>Governor</i> &amp;
<i>Colonel</i>, of <i>Virginia</i>. Northern Sons of Liberty. &amp; a good price for
our comodities.&mdash;This Day the Person who carried my Letters to
Baltimore returned without any Letters or Intelligence.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 26.</i></p>

<p>The weather this morning seems to have moderated&mdash;Miss <i>Nancy</i> is
poorly but better&mdash;In the Evening I ran a Foot Race with Ben &amp;
Harry fo exercise, &amp; a prize of ten Apples to the winner. We ran
from the School-House round the stable, &amp; Kitchen &amp; Great-House
which Distance is about 70 Rod&mdash;I came out first about One Rod;
but almost wholly spent; I went to my Chamber and lay down, sick,
fainty, &amp; quite distressed. I puked several times; after having rested
a while, however, I revived &amp; went well to Supper, &amp; Spend the
Evening in Writing. At Supper from the conversation I learned that
the slaves in this Colony never are married, their Lords thinking them
improper Subjects for so valuable an Institution!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 27.</i></p>

<p>The morning mild Serene and moderate&mdash;The Colonel is making
preparations for a Journey to <i>Anapolis</i>, where he Designs next
Month. In the Evening, (for here they call the time between Dinner
and day-light-End Evening,) He &amp; Mrs Carter shewed me their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
House; the original Design, the present form; &amp; what is yet to be
Done&mdash;Miss <i>Nancy</i> came down stairs to Day&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 28.</i></p>

<p>Snows this morning Briskly&mdash;Ben in a great Fever lest the Weather
shall stop him from a Ride he has alloted for tomorrow&mdash;At twelve
the Snow ceased, Depth about five Inches&mdash;I corrected <i>Harry</i> for the
first time to-day for expressing himself indecently to <i>Prissy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Saturday 29.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> is preparing himself to go out&mdash;while we were dining about three
it began to Snow briskly&mdash;After Dinner when I went over to my
Room I was very much surprised to find my Room full of Smoke &amp;
Flame!&mdash;A kind Providence only prevented the total Loss of our
School-House &amp; all its Furniture, &amp; our own Clothes Books &amp;c!&mdash;A
Coal of Fire had by accident (as the Hearth is very narrow) fall'n
on the floor, it took fire, &amp; when I entered it was burning rapidly&mdash;It
had burnt three Boards about eight Inches from the Hearth, &amp;
most certainly in a short time would have been inextinguishable&mdash;I
put it out however speedily, &amp; had all the fire removed&mdash;</p>

<p>The Weather is as wintry here in every Respect as I have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
known it in New-Jersey&mdash;Mr Carter has a Cart &amp; three pair of Oxen
which every Day bring in four Loads of Wood, Sundays excepted,
&amp; yet these very severe Days we have none to spare; And indeed I do
not wonder, for in the <i>Great House</i>, <i>School</i> House, Kitchen, &amp;c.
there are twenty Eight steady fires! &amp; most of these are very Large!&mdash;After
Supper, when all had retired but Mrs Carter, Mr Carter &amp;
Myself, the Conversation being on serious Matters, Mr Carter observed
that he much dislikes the common method of making Burying
Yards round Churches, &amp; having them almost open to every Beast&mdash;He
would have them at some small distance from the Church, neatly
&amp; strongly inclosed, and the Graves kept up decent, &amp; plain, but
would have no splendid, nor magnificent Monument, nor even Stone
to say "Hic jacet."&mdash;He told us he proposes to make his own Coffin
&amp; use it for a Chest til its proper use shall be required&mdash;That no
Stone, nor Inscription to be put over him&mdash;And that he would choose
to be laid under a shady Tree where he might be undisturbed, &amp; sleep
in peace &amp; obscurity&mdash;He told us, that with his own hands he planted,
&amp; is with great diligence raising a <i>Catalpa</i>-Tree at the Head of his
Father who lies in his Garden&mdash;Mrs Carter beg'd that She might have
a Stone, with this only for a Monument, "Here lies <i>Ann Tasker
Carter</i>."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> with these things for my consideration I left them about
ten and went to my cold Room, &amp; was hurried soon to Bed; Not
however without reflecting on the importance of our preparation for
this great Change!</p>


<p><i>Sunday 30.</i></p>

<p>Very stormy this morning with Rain and Hail which instantly
freezes; the trees hang bending with Ice, &amp; the ways are all glassy &amp;
slippery&mdash;None think of going to Church this day&mdash;Mrs Carter &amp;
I after Breakfast had a long conversation on religious affairs&mdash;Particularly
on differing Denominations of Protestants&mdash;She thinks the
Religion of the established Church without Exception the best of any
invented or practised in the world. &amp; indeed she converses with great
propriety on these things, &amp; discovers her very extensive Knowledge;
She allows the Difference between the Church, &amp; Presbyterianism to
be only exceeding small, &amp; wishes they were both intirely united!
Through this whole Day it storms but the Evening is terrible! almost
an Inundation of Rain; The wind violent at North-East; The Snow,
Hail, and Rain freezing together on the Ground! This Evening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Negroes collected themselves into the School-Room, &amp; began to play
the <i>Fiddle</i>, &amp; dance&mdash;I was in Mr Randolphs Room;&mdash;I went among
them, <i>Ben</i>, &amp; <i>Harry</i> were of the company&mdash;<i>Harry</i> was dancing with
his Coat off&mdash;I dispersed them however immediately.</p>


<p><i>Monday 31.</i></p>

<p>Excessive sloppy&mdash;Miss <i>Nancy</i> came to School to Day&mdash;I finished
my verses which are to be presented as a Valantine to Miss <i>Prissy
Carter</i>.</p>


<p><i>Teusday February 1st 1774.</i></p>

<p>Fair &amp; mild but vastly muddy&mdash;About twelve Squire <i>Lee</i> &amp; young
<i>Harry Lee</i>, who was a College-Fellow, came to see us. They staid
while about five. The Toasts at Dinner were as usual&mdash;The Colonel
&amp; Mrs Carter seem Much pleased with Harry, &amp; with his manner.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 2.</i></p>

<p>The weather vastly fine. At twelve o-Clock the Colonel &amp; Miss <i>Prissy</i>
rode out for an airing&mdash;<i>Prissy</i> This day began Multiplication. We
had also a large elegant Writing Table brought to us, so high that
the Writers must stand.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 3.</i></p>

<p>Prissy, &amp; Nancy practising music&mdash;We had last night Thunder,
Lightning, &amp; a very great shower.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 4.</i></p>

<p>I put Ben this day into virgil&mdash;We had our Room mended &amp; came
into it&mdash;at twelve I rode out to Mr Taylors about two Miles, in
again by Dinner-Time&mdash;Dined with us one Mrs Hut&mdash;This Evening,
in the School-Room, which is below my Chamber, several Negroes
&amp; <i>Ben,</i> &amp; <i>Harry</i> are playing on a <i>Banjo</i> &amp; dancing!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 5:</i></p>

<p>I spent the morning in my Room, <i>Ben</i>, &amp; <i>Bob</i> are gone out. About
twelve came on a visit Mr <i>Goodlett</i>, &amp; <i>Saml Fantleroy</i>;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> I spent the
remainder of the day with them.&mdash;At Dinner when call'd upon for
a Toast I gave Miss <i>Sally Hollinshead</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Mr Goodlett told me he has had an Invitation, to accept a School in
<i>Leeds</i>,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> a town on the River Rapahannock, about 25 Miles from
this up &amp; across the Country.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 6.</i></p>

<p>I rode to Church; Mrs Carter &amp; Miss Prissy &amp; Nancy were out&mdash;Mr
Smith gave us a Sermon 14 Minutes long on Charite&mdash;But poor Fellow
he seem'd Cold as his Subject! Mr Fantleroy; &amp; Mr Goodlett
dined with us and set off for Home as soon as we rose from Dinner&mdash;This
day two Negro Fellows the Gardiner &amp; cooper, wrangled; &amp;
at last fought; It happened hard however for the Cooper, who is
likely to lose one of his Eyes by that Diabolical Custom of gouging
which is in common practise among those who fight here&mdash;Evening
Ben returned; he has been into Northumland to see one Mr <i>Jones</i>.
Mr Goodlett, to Day, shewed me a piece of his own performance, a
paraphrase on part of the Book of Job, done in Lattin-Verse.</p>


<p><i>Monday 7.</i></p>

<p>The Day pleasant, &amp; seems to have some appearance of Spring&mdash;Mr
Blain call'd this Affternoon, &amp; told us that by a Letter he hears
Lady <i>Dunmore</i> is arrived from New-York<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>&mdash;and that many good &amp;
wealthy Families arrived in the same Ship&mdash;It is indeed amazing, &amp; it
will soon astonish the whole World, to consider the Rapidity of the
growth of these Colonies&mdash;</p>

<p>At Supper, Mr Carter informed me it is his purpose to manifacture
30.000 Bushels of wheat in his New-Mill which is yet scarcely
finished.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 8.</i></p>

<p>Before Breakfast <i>Nancy</i> &amp; <i>Fanny</i> had a Fight about a Shoe Brush
which they both wanted&mdash;Fanny pull'd off her Shoe &amp; threw at
Nancy, which missed her and broke a pane of glass of our School
Room. they then enter'd upon close scratching &amp;c. which methods
seem instinctive in Women. Harry happen'd to be present &amp; affraid
lest he should be brought in, ran and informed me&mdash;I made peace,
but with many threats&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs Carter has ordered the Gardener to sew Lettice, &amp; plant Peas
this Day in the Garden.&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><i>Wednesday 9.</i></p>

<p>This day very blustry &amp; cold&mdash;I gave Prissy a Coppy of Secretary-Hand,
at her particular Request&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 10.</i></p>

<p>We had the Virginia Gazette<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to day in which the accounts concerning
the destroying the Tea at Boston are confirm'd&mdash;&amp; also an
account of the Burning of the House of Governor Tryon. Dined
with us Colonel <i>Frank Lee</i>; his Wife &amp; Captain <i>John Lee</i>. Toasts after
Dinner, the <i>King</i>. <i>Queen</i>. Absent Friends, Governor of Virginia, &amp;
his Lady just arrived, &amp; Success to American Trade &amp; Commerce</p>


<p><i>Fryday 11.</i></p>

<p>The Company staid all Night&mdash;at Breakfast the conversation was
on a terrible Distemper which is in this County at present; &amp; which
in Maryland last year about this time carried off hundreds, and is
call'd the "<i>putrid Quinsy</i>." Mr Carter has a Man lying now dangerously
ill of it!</p>

<p>What they do in the Disorder is, when the Inflamation is first observ'd,
bleeding; then give the <i>Bark</i> &amp; <i>Salt-petre</i>, or <i>Nitre</i>, and <i>Gargles</i>
to cleanse the mouth&mdash;</p>

<p>Our company left us before dinner&mdash;Last night I took Bob to my
Room, after having in the course of the Day corrected him thrice,
&amp; reasoned with him concerning the impropriety of his Behaviour;
at the same time I acquainted him with my final resolution to send
him over for correction every Day to his Papa's Study, which had
so strong an Effect on him (as all the Children are in remarkable
Subjection to their Parents) that he firmly pomised to attend to my
advice, &amp; thro' this Day has been punctual to his word.</p>

<p>I spent the evening with the Family to hear the music. For every
evening Prissy &amp; Nancy play the whole Evening for practice &amp; besides
every Week half of Teusday, Thursday, &amp; Saturday. We were
informed that the <i>Carter</i> who goes with the Team is ill of the sore
Throat!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 12.</i></p>

<p>After having dismised the School I went over to Mr Carters Study&mdash;We
conversed on many things, &amp; at length on the College of William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
&amp; Mary at <i>Williamsburg</i>. He informed me that it is in such confusion
at present, &amp; so badly directed, that he cannot send his Children
with propriety there for Improvement &amp; useful Education&mdash;That he
has known the Professors to play all Night at Cards in publick
Houses in the City, and has often seen them drunken in the Street!&mdash;That
the Charter of the College is vastly Extensive, &amp; the yearly income
sufficient to support a University being about 4.000. Sterling.&mdash;That
the Necessary Expence for each Scholar yearly is only 15
Currency.</p>

<p>Two of the officers of the Institution, Mr Bracker, &amp; Mr Henly<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Clergymen are at present engaged in a paper War published weekly
in the Williamsburg Gazette's.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny quite unwell of a Cold with a pain in her Breast.
Evening Mrs Carter complain'd of a sore throat; and <i>Ben</i> also, complains
that his Throat is quite troublesome&mdash;Mr Randolph too is confin'd
in his Room all day! We seem to be all sickning!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 13.</i></p>

<p>Things look better this morning Mrs Carter, &amp; <i>Ben</i> seem relieved,
Mr Randolph, &amp; Fanny are better. The morning very blustry with
wind &amp; Snow&mdash;None go to Church from here to day&mdash;In my Room
I read <i>Pictete</i>.</p>


<p><i>Monday 14.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Randolph</i> this Morning happens to be Miss <i>Nancy's Valentine</i>;
&amp; Miss <i>Prissy</i> mine,&mdash;The morning sharp &amp; very cold&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 15.</i></p>

<p>I have a call this morning from <i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Harry</i> for a Holiday, for
Shrove Teusday; I shall dismiss them at twelve o-Clock. I gave Miss
Carter my Verses for her Valentine, Dined with us Mrs <i>Ford</i>. I
finished reading the first, &amp; began the Second Volume of <i>Pictete</i>.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 16.</i></p>

<p>I happened last monday to offend <i>Prissy</i>, She retains her anger &amp;
seems peculiarly resentful!&mdash;<i>Ben</i> agreed for half a Bit a Week to play
the Flute every Night, or read, for me, twenty Minutes after I am in
Bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><i>Thursday 17.</i></p>

<p>Prissy seems much affronted; The Cause was as follows Monday afternoon,
by Chance I tapp'd her on the Head, &amp; wholly in Jest; She
seem'd vex'd, but Teusday morning which is her day for practice on
the Forte-Piano, after Breakfast, I desir'd her to walk over to the
School, she refused, &amp; gave for an Excuse that She must begin to
play&mdash;Both these things laid together were the cause of her resentment.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 18.</i></p>

<p>The Weather pleasant and moderate&mdash;<i>Bob</i>, <i>Nancy</i>, &amp; <i>Prissy</i>, are
setting off this morning to the Dance, which is at Mr <i>Washingtons</i><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 19.</i></p>

<p>at Dinner we were conversing on Reading, among many remarks the
Colonel observed that, He would bet a Guinea that Mrs Carter reads
more than the Parson of the parish! No panegyrick on the Gentleman?
Mr Christian the Dancing Master, Came home with the young
Ladies.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><i>Sunday 20.</i></p>

<p>Last Evening the virginia News-papers came; but nothing from the
Northward.</p>

<p>Rode to Nomini Church; Parson Smith read Prayers, but it was too
Cold a Day to give us a Sermon; After Service <i>Mr &amp; Mrs Carter</i>, the
Parson, his wife &amp; Sister; Mr <i>Camel</i> the Comptroler; <i>Ben</i>, <i>Bob</i>, Miss
<i>Pierce</i>, Miss <i>Sanford</i>, and My self were invited to Colonel Washingtons
to Dinner. His House has the most agreeable Situation, of any
I have yet seen in Maryland or Virginia; the broad Potowmack,
which they account between 7 and 8 Miles over, washes his Garden
on the North. the River Nomini is within a stones throw on the West,
a levil open Country on the East; a Lane of a mile &amp; three quarters
accurately measur'd. lies from the House South-East it has from the
House the whole distance a uniform Descent, &amp; at the Gate at the
End of this Lane the Situation is just six feet lower than at the House&mdash;There
are no Marshes near, which altogether make the place exceeding
Description. The Roads are now miry &amp; disagreeable.</p>


<p><i>Monday 21.</i></p>

<p>Prissy seems again reconciled&mdash;Miss <i>Stanhope</i> the Housekeeper
is ill of a Rheumatism&mdash;They are begining to work in the Garden
with vigor. Dined with us Docter <i>Franks</i>.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 22.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Carter</i> rode to the County-Court. I read to day several chapters
in the Greek testament. Mr <i>Carter</i> has given orders to his Hands to
rigg, &amp; fit his Schooner a Vessel of about 40 Tons for Business. Docter
Franks with us yet. Mrs <i>Carter</i> was taken ill last Evening &amp; has
not been out of her chamber to Day. Miss <i>Stanhope</i> the Housekeeper
is also confin'd to her Room with Rheumatic Pains.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday. 23.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Carter</i> has an invitation to dine at Lee-Hall to Day, which he
accepts&mdash;before Dinner came in Miss <i>Corbin,</i> &amp; Miss <i>Booth</i>; two
young Ladies pretty well gone in what we call the Bloom of Life;
Mr Carter was out, Mrs Carter is ill, &amp; Ben was not Drest; Bob &amp; I
therefore at Dinner must be Directors of the ceremonies at Table!
But happily for me I have them at last all by heart&mdash;At five Bob &amp; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had the Pleasure to walk home with them, (for they were on foot)
to Assist them in Crossing the River Nomini which lies between us
&amp; Mr Turburville's. Evening Mrs Carter seems no better&mdash;Miss Sally
came out of her Room&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 24.</i></p>

<p>Frogs croaked last Evening. This morning the Birds of several kinds
are singing; and some presages of Spring seem visible. Mrs Carter
continues no better, A messenger is sent for Docter <i>Jones</i>, with
orders, that if he is from Home to pursue him.&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr <i>Gregory</i>,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> the Colonels Gardiner came this morning &amp; began
with Mr <i>Carters</i> two Fellows who have been in the Garden all winter&mdash;They
planted this day the common garden Peas.</p>

<p>The Colonel at Dinner gave Ben &amp; I a Piece of Music to prepare on
our Flutes, in which he is to perform the thorough Bass&mdash;Evening
Mrs Carter Some Better.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 25.</i></p>

<p>Mrs Carter better&mdash;The Day pleasant&mdash;There is a report that the
Jail-Fever, or Yellow or putrid Fever, is at one Mr Atwel's on potowmack,
in this County; that it was brought in a Ship which came lately
with convict Servants; that two have already died, one this morning:
&amp; that many of Mr Atwells Slaves are infected!&mdash;</p>

<p>Docter Jones spent the Evening with us; He complimented <i>Ben</i>
<i>Bob</i>, &amp; myself with an invitation to dine with him next Sunday.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 26.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Carter's</i> Merchant Mill begins to run to-day&mdash;She is calculated to
manufacture 25.000 Bushels of Wheat a Year&mdash;I walked at twelve
with the Colonel to view her; it is amazing to consider the work and
Ingenuity&mdash;He told me his Bill for the materials and work was
1450.!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ben</i> to day Rode to Mr <i>Fantleroys</i>. Evening the Colonel &amp; I performed
the <i>Sonata</i>. I had the Pleasure to hear the Colonel say that I
have my part perfect.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 27.</i></p>

<p>I rode to day to Richmond Church, Parson Gibbern preached about
20 Minutes on the Text "he that walketh uprightly walketh wisely"&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
seems to be a polite part of the parish.&mdash;After Sermon Ben &amp;
I rode to Docter <i>Jones's</i>; he was from home. Mrs Jones a young,
Handsome, polite Lady, received &amp; entertained us exceeding civilly.&mdash;On
our return home, we called to see Mr Hamilton, who by a
accident was thrown from a Horse, &amp; received a sad cut in his Face!
he lies at Mr Lanes.</p>


<p><i>Monday 28.</i></p>

<p>Mrs Carter confined yet to her Room, but much better&mdash;Prissy &amp;
I on good terms once more&mdash;Breakfasted with us Mr <i>Taylor</i>.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Ben
determines to ask his Papa to-morrow for Liberty to go home with
me in April. Evening we performed the Sonata I the first; Ben the
second; &amp; Mr Carter the thorough Bass on the <i>Forte Piano</i>.</p>


<p><i>Teusday March 1st 1774.</i></p>

<p>By one of Mr Carters Sailors we heard this morning that the Fever
mentioned some Days ago continues. Afternoon Mr Lane<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> a young
Gentleman, formerly my acquaintance at Princeton came to see me;
with one Mr Harison&mdash;He stays all night.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 2.</i></p>

<p>I gave my little family a Holiday, with an intention to ride with Mr
Lane after Dinner&mdash;We walked to the Mill, &amp; about the works, but
before twelve it began to rain, &amp; prevented our going out&mdash;Mrs
<i>Carter</i> came out of her chamber &amp; dined with us, &amp; seems to be well
over Illness.</p>

<p>Mr Lane lives in Louden County 20 Miles from Dumfries; &amp; is to return
to Princeton towards the close of this month.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 3.</i></p>

<p>Late last Evening the Packets came in: In the Pennsylvania Gazette
I saw that Docter <i>Elmer</i> of my acquaintance in Jersey; &amp; Docter
Jones at whose House I dined Last Sunday are created members of
the American Philosophical Society.&mdash;In the virginia Papers there is
an Account of an Earthquake felt on monday the 21 ult. at <i>Williamsburg</i>,
<i>Richmond</i>, &amp; <i>Fredericksburg</i>&mdash;After Breakfast Mr Lane left
us, He was drest in black superfine Broadcloth; Gold-Laced hat;
laced Ruffles; black Silk Stockings; &amp; to his Broach on his Bosom he
wore a Masons Badge inscrib'd "Virtute and Silentio" cut in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Golden Medal! Certainly he was fine!&mdash;Mrs Carter continues better.
Evening we performed again in the several parts our Sonata&mdash;<i>Ben</i>
mentioned to his Mama, as Mr Lane's coming hindred his asking
his <i>Papa</i> for his Consent to go to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>She seems to be not unwilling.</p>

<p>Expence to Day for Paper a Bitt, or 7d.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 4.</i></p>

<p>I gave the <i>Hostler</i> directions for preparing my Horse for the approaching
expedition. In a Ship arrived last week in Potowmack Mr
Carter received half a Dozen of the latest Gent. Magazines with several
other new Books,</p>

<p>This day I wrote two Letters to be forwarded by Mr Lane, one to
a young Lady in Philadelphia the other to my Sister.</p>

<p>No news of beautiful <i>Laura</i>; perhaps I may say of her, to myself:
Quid insanis, Philippe, tua lura <i>Laura</i>,&mdash;Alium&mdash;secuta est! Keep
her, kind Heaven, &amp; in her Friendship make me happy! After School
at Evening, on account of some difference about the Key of the
School-Room Ben gave Harry a smart, but just correction; I kept in
my Room that I might be wholly unconcerned in the matter.</p>

<p>There came in about eight o-Clock a man very drunk, &amp; grew exceeding
noisy &amp; troublesome, &amp; as the Evening was cold &amp; stormy
Mr Carter thought it improper to send him away; he was therefore
ordered into the Kitchen, to stay the Night: Him Bob soon after persuaded
to the School-house; I soon heard from my Room the noise
&amp; guesed immediately the Cause. I waited however 'til half after ten,
when all seemed silent; I then took a candle &amp; went into the School-Room,
And before the Fire Bob had brought a matt, &amp; Several Blankets,
&amp; was himself in a sound sleep covered with the Blankets on the
same Matt between the drunken Man, &amp; a Negro Fellow, his Papas
Postilion! I mention this as one Example among a thousand to shew
the very particular Taste of this Boy!&mdash;I could mention another
which would illustrate what I have said of this passion for Horses
when I gave a Scetch of his character, <i>Ben</i> has a very sightly young
mare which he has in keeping for our intended Journey; this morning
Bob agreed to give his Brother a Pisterene, &amp; a rich Tortoise-Shell
Handled Knife bound elegantly with Silver, only for Liberty to ride
this Mare every day to Water, until his Brother sets away, &amp; would
consent to be limited as to the Gait he should use in Riding&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
borrowed the late Magazines &amp; read them in my Leisure. I am
daily more charmed &amp; astonished with Mrs Carter. I think indeed
she is to be placed in the place with Ladies of the first Degree.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 5.</i></p>

<p>Very stormy this morning, no going out: I spend the day very agreeably
at Home. Mr Carter appointed to <i>Ben</i>, &amp; I another <i>Sonata</i> to
practise. He wrote for Miss <i>Nancy</i> also "Infancy" to get by Heart &amp;
sing it with the <i>Guitar</i>. The day continues stormy; <i>Bob</i>, however,
has ventured out; for neither Heat, nor Cold, nor Storm can stay
him!&mdash;</p>

<p>We dined at three&mdash;The Colonel at Dinner observed that many of
the most just, &amp; nervous sentiments are contain'd in Songs &amp; small
Sketches of Poetry; but being attended with <i>Frippery Folly</i> or <i>Indecency</i>
they are many times look'd over. I am remarkably pleased
with the Monument erected to the memory of General <i>Wolfe</i> in the
universal Magazine for September 1773. The General is there represented
in an expiring Posture, supported by an English Soldier, who
seems to comfort him in his last moments, by directing his closing
Eyes to a Figure representing Victory, holding in one hand a palm-Branch,
the emblem of peace; &amp; a Crown or Wreath of immortality
in the other, which she offers the dying commander; while he himself
seems to make a final effort to express his Sattisfaction at her Appearance.
On the corners of the Base are two Lions couchant, the Emblems
of the british Nation, supporting the Sarcophagus or marble
Urn, &amp; intended to express the gratitude of his native country for his
eminent Services. On the first pannel of the Base is an elegant alto
Relievo, representing the debarkation of the Troops at the Foot of
the Heights of Abraham.</p>

<p>The Writer says that the Height of the Monument from the
Ground-Line to the top of the Tent, is nearly twenty-seven feet;
that the figures are considerably larger than the Life, &amp; beautifully
executed.</p>

<p>On an oval Tablet on the front of the Urn are inscribed the underwritten
Lines.</p>

<p class="center">

</p>

<p>Honour is here indeed done to merit, and Valour is justly
eternized!&mdash;</p>

<p>I was reading in the Evening to <i>Bob</i> in the Monthly Review the
remarks on the Poetry and writings of <i>Phillis Wheatly</i><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> of Boston;
at which he seem'd in astonishment; sometimes wanting to see her,
then to know if She knew grammer, Latin, &amp;c. at last he expressed
himself in a manner very unusual for a Boy of his turn. &amp; suddenly
exclaimed, Good God! I wish I was in Heaven!&mdash;The Weather is so
stormy I chose to forego my Supper, rather than venture into the
dark, &amp; Water. In bed a little after ten which is our usual time.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 6.</i></p>

<p>I rose at eight&mdash;The morning cold &amp; stormy&mdash;<i>Ben</i> is distressed that he
cannot go to Church; I cannot say but I enjoy myself with great
Satisfaction tho' I stay most of my time in my Chamber; &amp; often have
to withstand the solicitations of Gentlemen to visit them.</p>

<p>Breakfasted at half after nine. Mr Lane the other Day informed me
that the <i>Anabaptists</i> in <i>Louden County</i> are growing very numerous;
&amp; seem to be increasing in afluence; and as he thinks quite destroying
pleasure in the Country; for they encourage ardent Pray'r; strong &amp;
constant faith, &amp; an intire Banishment of <i>Gaming</i>, <i>Dancing</i>, &amp; Sabbath-Day
Diversions. I have also before understood that they are
numerous in many County's in this Province &amp; are Generally accounted
troublesome&mdash;Parson <i>Gibbern</i> has preached several Sermons
in opposition to them, in which he has labour'd to convince his People
that what they say are only whimsical Fancies or at most Religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
grown to Wildness &amp; Enthusiasm!&mdash;There is also in these counties
one Mr Woddel,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> a presbiterian Clergyman, of an irreproachable
Character, who preaches to the people under Trees in summer, &amp; in
private Houses in Winter, Him, however, the people in general dont
more esteem than the Anabaptists Preachers; but the People of Fashion
in general countenance, &amp; commend him. I have never had an
opportunity of seeing Mr <i>Woddel</i>, as he is this Winter up in the
Country, but Mr &amp; Mrs <i>Carter</i> speak well of him, Mr &amp; Mrs <i>Fantleroy</i>
also, &amp; all who I have ever heard mention his Name. Like <i>Bob</i> I am
at once fill'd with pleasure &amp; surprise, when I see the remarks of the
Reviewers confirmed as to the Writings of that ingenious <i>African
Phillis Wheatly</i> of Boston; her verses seem to discover that She is
tolerably well acquainted with <i>Poetry</i>, <i>Learning</i>, &amp; <i>Religion</i>. In the
universal Magazine for September 1773 are the following Lines on
her being brought from <i>Africa</i> to <i>America</i> by herself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan Land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taught my benighted Soul to understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there's a God; that there's a Saviour too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once I Redemption neither sought nor knew,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>&mdash;The people Went to day as usual into the Woods with the Cart &amp;
Oxen for Wood, as the cold and stormy Weather the several days
past has occasioned large, &amp; steady fires&mdash;It seems however to be a
Breach of the Law of the Sabbath. <i>Ben</i> impatient of staying at home
rode out about Eleven, when the weather is more moderate; <i>Bob</i>,
<i>Harry</i> &amp; Mr <i>Randolph</i> also are all going out; I seem happy when
intirely alone, &amp; have undisturbed liberty to spend in Devotion God's
holy Sabbath of Rest.</p>

<p>Before Night it grew fair when on a Sudden all are out, so that we
seem like a Town; but most of the Inhabitants are black&mdash;We dined
at three, no company. Evening <i>Bob</i> returned &amp; brought Mr Turburville's
Compliments, with a strong invitation for me to visit him&mdash;A
little before the Sun went down I took a walk down the Poplar
Avenue; which must certainly be vastly pleasant in Summer&mdash;At the
farthest end of this Walk I gathered &amp; eat some Pisimmonds from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
large Tree which were exceeding sweet, &amp; agreeable. Supped at nine,
At Supper The Colonel informed me that he has invented this Day a
method for finding the difference of the value of money in this
<i>Province</i> and in <i>Maryland</i>. We do not spend Sundays thus in Jersey.
In Bed by ten. Ben at home.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Monday 7.</i></p>


<p>The morning vastly clear &amp; cool&mdash;The Colonel rode to Richmond
court at twelve, with Mr <i>Randolph</i>, I walked to see the Negroes
make a fence; they drive into the Ground Chesnut stakes about two
feet apart in a strait Row, &amp; then twist in the Boughs of <i>Savin</i><a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
which grows in great plenty here&mdash;Ben, to Day, began Virgils
Georgics&mdash;And Prissy began Division&mdash;By accident to day in the
Garden I took up Mr <i>Gegory</i> the Gardiners Spade, for which he
instantly called on me for my forfeit&mdash;This Gardiner through the
Summer from this Time has half a Crown daily Wages&mdash;Dined at
half after two.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 8.</i></p>

<p>I rose by six&mdash;the morning fine. Breakfasted at nine. At twelve I
walked, to the mill together with Mr &amp; Mrs Carter; Miss Prissy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&amp;
Nancy, to see them bake Biscuit, &amp; pack flour; here too I had a Forfeit
for kneeding biscuit. The Colonel shewed me and explain'd the Pan
of his Mill; his Canals; Waste-gates; Toll Mill, Merchant Mill: &amp;c.
The tide flows quite to the Mill &amp; is navigable with Canoes &amp; Flats&mdash;He
told me that his Wastgate as it stands alone cost him 95.&mdash;And
that nothing less than 5000 Capital can continue the works &amp; keep
them supplied. The Ovens bake 100lb of Flour at a Heating; there
are in the Bake-house two Ovens. Dined half after two.</p>

<p>The Colonel formed last Sunday, &amp; is yet compleating Tables for
finding the Difference between <i>Virginia</i>, &amp; <i>Maryland</i> Currency, as
he is entering largely into Trade he finds it necessary to be better
acquainted with the Exchange. <i>Ben</i> agreed to ask his Papa at Supper
for Leave to go with me to Philadelphia but poor Boy his resolution
fail'd him!</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 9.</i></p>

<p>Up by seven, very Windy&mdash;Evening I rode with Ben to Mr <i>Lanes</i> to
see young Lane; he was out however, &amp; we soon returned&mdash;Mr
Warden was at Mr Lanes. Evening we played in our small Concert
our old Sonata; &amp; besides Feltons Gavott,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> supp'd at nine.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 10.</i></p>

<p>Mrs <i>Carter</i> informed me last Evening that this Family one year with
another consumes 27000 Lb of Pork; &amp; twenty Beeves. 550 Bushels of
Wheat. besides corn&mdash;4 Hogsheads of Rum, &amp; 150 Gallons of Brandy.
Breakfasted with us Mr Warden, at twelve, with Mr Randolph, I
went a fishing, but we had only the luck to catch one apiece. Dined
with us Mr <i>Cunningham</i>, he has lately had a severe turn of the
Pleurisy&mdash;I supped with Mr Randolph on Fish&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 11.</i></p>

<p>The finest morning we have yet had: the <i>Robbins,</i> &amp; <i>blue Birds</i> singing
all around us. <i>Prissy</i>, <i>Nancy</i>, &amp; <i>Bob</i> go this day to the <i>Dance</i>
which is at Mr Turburville's&mdash;It come here next&mdash;I wrote a Letter
to Mr Rees<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> at Trenton&mdash;At twelve with Ben I rode to Mr <i>Lanes</i>
to see young Mr <i>Lane</i>, he happened to be at Home, &amp; introduced to
me Mr <i>Middleton</i> an old facetious but pofane Gentleman. We dined
with Mr Lane. When call'd on for my Toast I gave Miss <i>Sally Hollinshead</i>,
of Philadelphia Dined at three&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>I heard a mocking Bird sing this Day. supped at eight &amp; in Bed early
for I am much fatigued with riding.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 12.</i></p>

<p>I rose by six&mdash;Breakfasted with us Captain <i>Blackwel</i>; master of a Ship
lying in <i>Ucomico</i>&mdash;I heard <i>Harry</i>, Miss <i>Fanny</i>, &amp; <i>Besy</i> repeat their
catechism&mdash;At ten Mr Lane called on us to go on Board Captain
Blackwels Ship to Dine&mdash;We consented and set off by Eleven; We
rode to a place called Horn-Point, which is about a Mile up the River
Ucomico, &amp; in sight of the wide <i>Potowmac</i>, off this point at about a
Quarter of a miles Distance lay Captain Griggs, &amp; Captain Blackwels
Ships, they sent immediately a Boat to carry us on board, but on telling
us that neither of the Captains were at Home, we chose rather
to turn Back&mdash;The distance from Mr <i>Carters</i> to this Point, is called
twelve miles; the Land seems to be exceeding poor, as it is covered
for most of the way with Large <i>Pines</i>, &amp; shrubby <i>Savins</i>, &amp; destitute
almost intirely of Cultivation&mdash;From Horn-Point we agreed to ride
to one Mr Camels, who is Controller of the customs &amp;c. here; cheifly
to see a Daughter of his to whom we were equally strangers, we
arrived at Mr Camels about two o-Clock, &amp; were severally introduced
to Miss Pinkstone Camel, a young woman of about sixteen,
neat, handsome, genteel, &amp; sociable; &amp; in my opinion she possesses as
much of these as any young Lady in Virginia whom I have yet seen&mdash;It
has been Mr Camels misfortune, in the course of trade, to be
reduced to low circumstances, on which account his Family does
not now meet with so great respect, as I am told they formerly did&mdash;</p>

<p>From Horn Point to the Comptrolers, the distance is call'd four
miles. Before Dinner we Borrowed the Comptrolers Barge, which is
an over grown Canoe, &amp; diverted ourselves in the River which lies
full fronting the House; &amp; we were the better pleased with the sport
as all our motions were in the sight of Miss Camel&mdash;We dined at half
after three on Fish, &amp; wild Duck&mdash;our drink Grogg, &amp; Water. From
the Comptrolers at 5 o-Clock we set of Homewards; we call'd on
our way at Captain <i>Meddletons</i>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> whom I take to be exceedingly
Profane in his Language; we were introduced to his two Daughters;
they seemed however aukward in their Behaviour, &amp; dull, &amp; saturnine
in their Disposition&mdash;The distance from the Comptrolers to Captain
seven Miles&mdash;We left there at eight in the evening, &amp; rode to Mr
Joseph Lanes Esqr which distance is called five miles, &amp; arrive at 9<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
o-Clock&mdash;here we had an elegant Supper&mdash;with good <i>Porter</i> &amp; Madeira&mdash;after
Supper, when call'd on for my Toast, I gave Miss <i>Betsy
Beaty</i> of Newington, Pennsylvania&mdash;At half after ten we set off and
rode home; Distance three miles, Our poor Horses went the distances
which I have laid down and were not fed in the course of the day;
as they have no taverns in these parts&mdash;Our whole Distance 31 Miles
Expence to the Sailors for their trouble is 1s 10d. Exceedingly fatigued
with Riding.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 13.</i></p>

<p>Soon after Breakfast Captain Scott (master of a Schooner laden with
Wheat, &amp; bound from Alexandria for Philadelphia, which about ten
days past in a gale of wind run aground and is like to lose her Cargo)
come to hire Mr Carters Schooner to assist in unloading her that the
vessel may be saved; the vessel run aground, &amp; now lies nearly opposite
the mouth of the River Nomini in Potowmack!&mdash;The Colonel is
engaged in taking off a Description of the River <i>Ucomico</i>; the Road
from hence to Horn-Point; &amp; Mondays-Point<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> with the Houses on
the several ways&mdash;This day I declin'd going to Church, chiefly on
account of my Horse, who went so far yesterday&mdash;It is however the
first time that I have kept myself at home in good weather&mdash;Evening
Mr Carter received a Packet of Letters from <i>Anopolis</i> by the Post,
but none comes to me this long Winter&mdash;Bob to-day rode to Richmond
Church, &amp; in the Evening brought from Counsellor <i>Taylor</i><a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
a strong invitation to come and see him.</p>


<p><i>Monday 14.</i></p>

<p>Bob this morning begg'd me to learn him lattin; his Reason he tells
me is that yesterday Mrs <i>Taylor</i><a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> told him he must not have either
of her Daughters unless he learn'd Latin he urged me so strong that
I put him some Lessons for leasure hours. Rainy most of this day, &amp;
in the afternoon from the West arose a black cloud which was
attended with several pretty hard Claps of Thunder&mdash;We had with
us one Mr <i>Neal</i> a good Sort of self sufficient Gentleman&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 15.</i></p>

<p>This morning, as Ben &amp; Bob were agreeing on the price of a Rudiman
Grammar, which <i>Bob</i> wanted to purchase of <i>Ben</i>; after some
time when Bob would not give 2/10. Bens great demand for a Book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
almost worn out, which when new, may, by thousands be had in
Philadelphia for 2/. that Currency&mdash;He threw his Book into the fire,
&amp; destroy'd it at once!&mdash;An Instance of two ruling Foibles which I
discover in Ben viz. obstinacy, &amp; avarice. And another I mentioned
the other day, of his agreeing, for half a Bit, or 3&frac12;d a week, to play
the flute for a limited time, every night after I am in Bed; of this
however he has grown tired, &amp; given up his wages on account of the
Labour, or Confinement of the Task&mdash;And I should be deceived, if
a very little money would not excite him to submit to almost any
menial service&mdash;Bob however; for the present is frustrated in his purpose
of learning Grammer, &amp; it seems to chagrin him as much, as
tho' he actually believed in what Mrs Taylor<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> told him last Sunday,
that without he understands Latin, he will never be able to win a
young Lady of Family &amp; fashion for his Wife.&mdash;At the Noon play-Hours
<i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Nelson</i> the Boy who waits on the School had a fight,
I know not on what account; it was Bobs misfortune in the course
of the Battle to receive a blow on his cheek near his Eye, which is
visible, &amp; brought the intelligence of the Quarrel to me, for all were
wholly silent till I made inquiry, when all in a moment seem'd to
turn &amp; try to convict him&mdash;In the Evening, after School, I took
them both to my Room and examined them of the reason, Place, and
manner of their fighting; from themselves it seem'd plain that they
fought for mere Diversion I therefore dismiss'd Nelson, &amp; kept Bob
til near Supper &amp; then gave him a smart correction &amp; dismiss'd him.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 16.</i></p>

<p>The morning cloudy &amp; windy, Breakfasted at nine&mdash;Mr Randolph
hurt himself by a Fall from a fence to day badly&mdash;Dined at half after
two&mdash;Towards Evening the clouds all scattered, the wind fell, &amp; left
the air pleasant: The Birds also seemed glad and merry&mdash;The whole
reminded me of a beautiful, &amp; memorable passage in <i>Milton</i>. "If
Chance the Radiant Sun with farewel-Sweet, Extend his Evening
Beam the fields revive, The Birds their notes renew, the bleating
Herds Attest their joy that Hill &amp; valley rings."</p>

<p>After school, I had the honour of taking a walk with Mrs Carter
through the Garden&mdash;It is beautiful, &amp; I think uncommon to see at
this Season peas all up two &amp; three Inches&mdash;We gathered two or
three Cowslips in full-Bloom; &amp; as many violets&mdash;The English Honey
Suckle is all out in green &amp; tender Leaves&mdash;Mr Gregory is grafting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
some figs&mdash;Mrs Carter shewed me her Apricot-Grafts; Asparagus
Beds &amp;c. Before Supper a Black cloud appeared in the West, at which
Mrs Carter discovered much concern as She is uncommonly affraid
both of wind and Thunder.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 17.</i></p>

<p>This morning Mr Carter put Miss <i>Fanny</i> to learning the Notes&mdash;While
we were breakfasting Mr <i>Stadley</i> the musician came; Miss
<i>Prissy</i> is with him; <i>Nancy</i> learns the <i>Guitar</i>, under the direction of
her <i>Papa</i>, as Mr Stadley does not understand playing on the <i>Guitar</i>&mdash;Dined
with us a young Gentleman Mr Fantleroy from <i>Hobbes-Hole</i>&mdash;He
seems to be a modest sensible, genteel young Fellow&mdash;I had the
pleasure of taking a walk in the Garden at five with Mr <i>Stadley</i>; <i>Bob</i>
along&mdash;He is a man of Sense, &amp; has great Skill in music. I spent the
Evening in the Room in the midst of music.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 18.</i></p>

<p>The morning damp &amp; disagreeable&mdash;Mr Stadley continues to Day
with Miss <i>Prissy</i>. We received this morning the <i>Williamsburg</i>
Gazette's&mdash;Several Addresses appear, and poetical Encomiums on the
Countess of Dunmore lately arrived there.</p>

<p>Mr. Bracken. &amp; Mr. Henley, are still contending in furious Combat,
but poor Henley seems to be on the verge of a Defeat&mdash;I have all
along intended, &amp; shall now attempt to give a short discription of
Nomini-Hall, &amp; the several Buildings, &amp; improvements adjoining it;
as well for my own amusement, as also to be able with certainty to
inform others of a Seat as magnificent in itself &amp; with as many surrounding
Conveniences, as any I have ever seen, &amp; perhaps equal to
any in this Colony&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr <i>Carter</i> now possesses 60000 Acres of Land; &amp; about 600 Negroes&mdash;But
his Estate is much divided, &amp; lies in almost every county in
this Colony; He has Lands in the neighbourhood of Williamsburg,
&amp; an elegant &amp; Spacious House in that City&mdash;He owns a great part
of the well known Iron-Works near Baltimore in Maryland&mdash;And
he has one or more considerable Farms not far from Anopolis. He
has some large tracts of Land far to the West, at a place call'd "Bull
Run," &amp; the "Great Meadows" among the mountains. He owns Lands
near Dumfries on the Potowmack; &amp; large Tracts in this &amp; the neighbouring
Counties.&mdash;Out of these Lands, which are situated so remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
from each other in various parts of these two large Provinces, Virginia,
&amp; Maryland, Mr Carter has chosen for the place of his habitation a
high spot of Ground in Westmoreland County at the Head of the
Navigation of the River Nomini, where he has erected a large Elegant
House, at a vast expence, which commonly goes by the name
of <i>Nomini-Hall</i>. This House is built with Brick, but the bricks have
been covered with strong lime Mortar; so that the building is now
perfectly white; It is seventy-six Feet long from East to west; &amp;
forty-four wide from North to South, two Stories high; the Pitch
of the lower story seventeen Feet, &amp; the upper Story twelve&mdash;</p>

<p>It has five Stacks of Chimneys, tho two of these serve only for
ornament. There is a beautiful Jutt, on the South side, eighteen feet
long, &amp; eight Feet deep from the wall which is supported by three
tall pillars&mdash;On the South side, or front, in the upper story are four
Windows each having twenty-four Lights of Glass. In the lower
story are two Windows each having forty-two Lights of Glass, &amp;
two Doors each having Sixteen Lights&mdash;At the East end the upper
story has three Windows each with eighteen Lights; &amp; below two
Windows both with eighteen Lights &amp; a Door with nine&mdash;</p>

<p>The North side I think is most beautiful of all; In the upper Story
is a Row of seven Windows with eighteen Lights a piece; and below
six windows, with the like number of lights; besides a large Portico
in the middle, at the sides of which are two Windows each with
eighteen Lights.&mdash;At the West end are no Windows&mdash;The Number
of Lights in all is five hundred, &amp; forty nine&mdash;There are four Rooms
on a Floor, disposed of in the following manner. Below is a dining
Room where we usually sit; the second is a dining-Room for the
Children; the third is Mr Carters study; &amp; the fourth is a Ball-Room
thirty Feet long&mdash;Above stairs, one Room is for Mr &amp; Mrs Carter;
the second for the young Ladies; &amp; the other two for occasional
Company&mdash;As this House is large, &amp; stands on a high piece of Land
it may be seen a considerable distance; I have seen it at the Distance
of six Miles&mdash;At equal Distances from each corner of this Building
stand four other considerable Houses, which I shall next a little describe.
First, at the North East corner, &amp; at 100 yards Distance stands
the School-House; At the North-West Corner, &amp; at the same Distance
stands the stable; At the South-West Corner, &amp; at the same
Distance, stands the Coach-House; And lastly, at the South-East
corner, &amp; at an equal distance stands the Work-House. These four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Houses are the corner of a Square of which the Great-House is the
Center&mdash;First the School-House is forty five feet long, from East to
West, &amp; twenty-seven from North to South; It has five well-finished,
convenient Rooms, three below stairs, &amp; two above; It is built with
Brick a Story &amp; a half high with Dormant Windows; In each Room
is a fire; In the large Room below-Stairs we keep our School; the
other two Rooms below which are smaller are allowed to Mr Randolph
the Clerk; The Room above the School-Room Ben and I live
in; &amp; the other Room above Stairs belongs to <i>Harry</i> &amp; <i>Bob</i>. Five of us
live in this House with great Neatness, &amp; convenience; each one has
a Bed to himself&mdash;And we are call'd by the Bell to the Great-House
to Breakfast &amp;c&mdash;The Wash-House is built in the same form, &amp; is of
the same Size of the School-House&mdash;From the front yard of the
Great House, to the Wash-House is a curious <i>Terrace</i>, covered finely
with Green turf, &amp; about five foot high with a slope of eight feet,
which appears exceeding well to persons coming to the front of the
House&mdash;This <i>Terrace</i> is produced along the Front of the House,
and ends by the Kitchen; but before the Front-Doors is a broad flight
of steps of the same Height, &amp; slope of the <i>Terrace</i>.</p>

<p>The Stable &amp; coach-House are of the same Length &amp; Breadth as
the School- and Wash-House, only they are higher pitched to be convenient
for holding Hay &amp; Fodder.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Due East of the Great House are two Rows of tall, flourishing,
beautiful, Poplars, beginning on a Line drawn from the School to the
Wash-House; these Rows are something wider than the House, &amp;
are about 300 yards Long, at the Eastermost end of which is the great
Road leading through Westmorland to Richmond. These Rows of
Poplars form an extreemely pleasant avenue, &amp; at the Road, through
them, the House appears most romantic, at the same time that it does
truly elegant&mdash;The Area of the Triangle made by the Wash-House,
Stable, &amp; School-House is perfectly levil, &amp; designed for a bowling-Green,
laid out in rectangular Walks which are paved with Brick, &amp;
covered over with burnt Oyster-Shells&mdash;In the other Triangle, made
by the Wash-House, Stable, &amp; Coach House is the Kitchen, a well-built
House, as large as the School-House, Bake-House; Dairy; Store-House
&amp; several other small Houses; all which stand due West, &amp; at a
small distance from the great House, &amp; form a little handsome Street.
These Building stand about a quarter of a Mile from a Fork of the
River Nomini, one Branch of which runs on the East of us, on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
are two Mills; one of them belongs to Mr Turburville, the other to
Mr Washington, both within a mile&mdash;another branch of the River
runs on the West of us, on which and at a small distance above the
House stands Mr Carters Merchant Mill,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> which I have in other
places described; to go to the mill from the House we descend I
imagine above an 100 Feet; the Dam is so broad that two carriages
may pass conveniently on it; &amp; the Pond from twelve to Eighteen
Foot water&mdash;at the fork Mr Carter has a Granary, where he lands his
Wheat, for the mill Iron from the Works &amp;c&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Evening Mr <i>Carter</i> sent for <i>Ben</i> &amp; I to play over the <i>Sonata</i>
which we have lately learn'd; we performed it, &amp; had not only Mr
Stadleys Approbation, but his praise; he did me the honour to say
that "I play a good Flute." He took a Flute also and play'd; which
put me in mind, at once, of the speech of the Shepherd in virgil.&mdash;Non
tu in Triviis, indocte, solebas Stridenti miserum Stipula disperdere
cament [carmen]. For when compared to him, the best that
Ben or I can do, is like Crows among Nightingales&mdash;We play'd till
ten, and separated, I gave to Miss Harriot, for saying a good lesson,
half a Bit&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 19.</i></p>

<p>The morning still wet &amp; disagreeable&mdash;Last night I dreamed much of
the Girl, which, I most of all others, esteem, &amp; admire; of <i>Laura</i>; But
oh! I dreamed She was treacherous!&mdash;If it be true, I must suppress
the Greatness of my Disappointment by reflecting that I had not
well enough considered this Sentiment of the <i>poet</i>, That,&mdash;Varium
et mutabile Femina&mdash;I discover weakness when I am writing in this
manner; but Anxiety, and mighty-Love carry me over the bounds
which I set for the regulation of my conduct&mdash;Dreams indeed are
vain &amp; false; But perhaps <i>Laura</i> may think that Lovers vows are
vain &amp; trifling as they!&mdash;I spend the day in my Room looking over
the Catalogue of the <i>Reviewers</i> for August, September, October &amp;
November 1773.&mdash;Ben, &amp; Bob, &amp; Harry, out tho the Day is bad&mdash;Mr
<i>Stadley</i> is yet busy with the young Ladies&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 20.</i></p>

<p>The weather still cloudy, damp, and disagreeable, but it is perfectly
calm; people here attribute this so long dullness to the Sun crossing
the Line which is to happen to-morrow&mdash;After Breakfast Mr Stadley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
left us, The day is so bad none of us go to Church&mdash;Before Dinner
I received from Mr Lane, by his Servant a Note, informing me that
he is to set out tomorrow for home&mdash;In return, by the Same bearer,
I wrote him my Compliments in a letter; desiring him to remember
me to my Acquaintances in Pennsylvania, &amp; New Jersey, as he will
probably soon see many of them&mdash;I spent much of this Day in Mr
Carters Library among the works of mighty-Men; I turned over
<i>Calmets</i>, Scripture prints, they are beautiful, &amp; vastly entertaining&mdash;At
Dinner by some means, I know not how a conversation was introduced
concerning the Souls of Women; Mrs <i>Carter</i> observed that
She has heard they have no Souls&mdash;Says Miss Priscilla in a moment if
I thought so I would not have spent all this morning in Reading; nor
would Women, (Said the well discerning Miss) be careful to avoid
any Shameful, or Sinful Action&mdash;It is not unlikly but those are the
private Sentiments of many among the Fair; &amp; no doubt they would
be generally and publickly practised if it should be universally admitted
that the Soul of a Woman is not to exist after the present Life.</p>


<p><i>Monday 21.</i></p>

<p>This day the days and nights are equal&mdash;The Sun enters <i>Aries</i>&mdash;Aries
[Libra] dies Somniq: pares ubi fecerit Horas, Et medium suis atq:
Umbris jam dividet Orbem. <i>Virgil.</i> Georgic I.</p>

<p>At Breakfast Mrs Carter asked me who is foremost in Arithmetic;
whether Bob, or Prissy? At which Mr Carter observed, that him of
his Sons whom he finds most capable of doing Business when he
leaves the World, &amp; his Estate, Shall have the management of the
whole, &amp; support the Rest. It seemed to me to be not an ill-chosen
Incentive to Diligence among the Boys&mdash;</p>

<p>This morning still cloudy, the wind at South&mdash;about ten a black-gloomy
cloud appeared in the west; it came over like Virgils&mdash;Omnia
Ventorum concurrere proelia [vidi]&mdash;The wind changed with the
cloud to the westward&mdash;Dined with us Mr Washington &amp; Mr Philip
Smith, Brother to the Parson of this parish, to whom I was formally
introduced&mdash;Toasts as usual&mdash;Towards Evening it grows more pleasant
&amp; after School, I had the pleasure of a walk in the Garden with
Mrs Carter, Miss Stanhope, &amp; Miss Harriot&mdash;The peas have grown
admirably since my last Walk; &amp; indeed all the Herbs seem sprouting&mdash;Harry
this Day finished vulgar Fractions, &amp; began Practice.
Expence to day as Pin-Money a Bit or 7&frac12; d</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><i>Teusday 22.</i></p>

<p>Once more the weather fine&mdash;Last night by some accident, the Main
Spring of my Watch either unhook'd or broke, for when I thought
She had run down, &amp; trying to wind her, I found the Chain made no
Resistance As there is no oppertunity here of having her refitted, I
seem in considerable difficulty&mdash;In Spite of all my strongest opposing
efforts, my thoughts dwell on that Vixen <i>Laura</i>. I strive to refuse
them admission, or harbour them in my heart, yet like hidden fire
they introduce themselves, &amp; seize; &amp; overcome me when perhaps I
am pursuing some amuseing or useful Study; on giving precepts &amp;
Directions to my little fair Seminary&mdash;At ten Mr Lane &amp; Mr John
Simpson call'd to see us&mdash;At twelve we had a pleasant walk in the
Garden&mdash;Mr Carter, &amp; Mrs Carter along&mdash;Mr Lane informs that he
has by particular Request, in the Absence of the Parson, Read the
funeral Service twice since he has been in the county, which is only
a few Weeks&mdash;He sets off for home soon; Mr Carter says he is in
Love, &amp; I think it is with Miss <i>Camel</i>. I was introduced to Mr <i>Simpson</i>:
He talks much; &amp; often mentions his having been to England&mdash;They
Dined with us; Toasts as usual. Evening I have the Tooth Ach.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 23.</i></p>

<p>I was almost wholly deprived of Sleep last night with a pain in my
Jaw &amp; Teeth; which conti[n]ues this morning so bad I scarce know
what, or how to do&mdash;Frail, &amp; weak nature; how we are forever teas'd,
&amp; vexed with Anciety in our minds, or Pains &amp; other distresses in our
Bodies!&mdash;We dined at half after two&mdash;It is now seven in the Evening
&amp; I am about entering into bed, as the pain has entirely left me, that
I may satisfy my Body for last nights loss of my usual rest, I leave
Ben by the Fire, poring over a History of England, nodding Sometimes,
however, &amp; impatient of the distance of nine o-Clock.&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 24.</i></p>

<p>At Breakfast Mr Carter entertained us with an account of what he
himself saw the other Day, which is a strong Representation of the
cruelty &amp; distress which many among the Negroes suffer in Virginia!
Mr Carter dined at Squire Lees some few Weeks ago; at the same
place, that day, dined also Mr George Turburville &amp; his Wife&mdash;As
Mr Carter rode up he observed Mr Turburvilles Coach-Man sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
on the Chariot-Box, the Horses off&mdash;After he had made his compliments
in the House, He had Occasion soon after to go to the Door,
when he saw the Coachman still sitting, &amp; on examination found that
he was there fast chained! The Fellow is inclined to run away, &amp;
this is the method which This Tyrant makes use of to keep him when
abroad; &amp; so soon as he goes home he is delivered into the pityless
Hands of a bloody Overseer!&mdash;In the Language of a Heathen I
query whether cunning old <i>Charon</i> will not refuse to transport this
imperious, haughty Virginian Lord When he shall happen to die
over the Styx to the Elysian Gardens; lest his Lordship in the passage
should take affront at the treatment, &amp; attempt to chain him also
to the Stygean Galley for Life!&mdash;</p>

<p>Or, In the language of a Christian, I query whether he may be admitted
into the peaceful Kingdom of Heaven where meekness, Holiness,
&amp; Brotherly-Love, are distinguishing Characteristicks?&mdash;</p>

<p>Tho the Pain in my Teeth has entirely left me, I am not therefore
free from distress; for to day I am attacked with a pain in my Head,
&amp; Fever; which hinders me from Walking out at twelve as is my
Custom!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 25.</i></p>

<p>I rose by seven&mdash;&amp; through Gods mercy I feel myself much relieved
of yesterdays complaints&mdash;The weather cloudy, cold, rainy at
times, &amp; unpleasant&mdash;Evening <i>Ben</i> took courage &amp; asked his <i>Papa</i> for
his consent to allow him to go with me to Philadelphia&mdash;The Colonel
very kindly, &amp; at the same time very Politely consented&mdash;For he
would not agree till he knew of me whether it is agreeable to me, &amp; at
my Request that he is to go&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 26.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> &amp; <i>Bob</i> are soon after Breakfast on Horseback; Breakfasted with
us one Lee, a Gentleman of what they call here the back Woods&mdash;He
seems indeed a little stiff in his manner; but he has had a long
Ride&mdash;I spend the Day close in my Room Reading Writing &amp;c&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 27.</i></p>

<p>An odd Jumble of affairs happened this morning&mdash;<i>Bob</i> drest himself
&amp; came into our Room &amp; in his usual way began to be pretty free in
telling us <i>News</i>. Amongst a vast quantity of other stuff he informed
<i>Ben</i> &amp; I that he heard Mr <i>Randolph</i> has the P... we both join'd in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
severely reprimanding for attempting to propogate so unlikely a
Tale&mdash;Why, Brother Ben, said the mischeivous Wretch I heard in
this Neighbourhood, yesterday a Report concerning you not much
to your&mdash;but I will conceal it&mdash;This inraged Ben he at first however
persuaded him but soon began to threaten loudly unless he told the
whole&mdash;why then, Brother said Bob, it is reported that two Sundays
ago you took Sukey (a young likely Negro Girl maid to Mrs Carters
youngest Son) into your stable, &amp; there for a considerable time
lock'd yourselves together!&mdash;Before Bob had done, the Bell rung
for Breakfast &amp; we parted&mdash;All went to Church to-day but Miss
<i>Nancy</i>, <i>Harry</i>, &amp; <i>Myself</i>&mdash;I spend the day agreeably in Mr <i>Carters</i>
Library&mdash;Evening when the Colonel returned, (for he dined at
Squire Lee's) he informed me of an affair which happened yesterday
in this County, One Smith, a Man of a Middle age who lives with his
aged Father, &amp; his Father too is old &amp; declining fast with disease&mdash;This
youth has lately made a will for his Father which he yesterday
compell'd him to sign; &amp; after the Good old Man had obliged him,
he beat and abused him (tho his father) in desperate manner it is
thought with a design to destroy him! Soon after this he discharged a
musket at his own Brother who was at some distance from him &amp;
lodged in his body eighteen large Shott!&mdash;Docters were immediately
call'd&mdash;&amp; officers directed to take the villian but he, with his Wife
have hid themselves in a Thicket &amp; have as yet evaded the search of
the Sheriff&mdash;</p>

<p>Sup'd with us one Mr Mathews a Steward for Mr Carter in Louden.</p>


<p>[<i>Monday 28</i>]</p>

<p>Breakfasted with us Mr Mathews; he seems to be a man of great
Gravity, says little, &amp; Sighs often&mdash;The day is warm &amp; vastly mild; it
is the first Day we have in all our Rooms been without any Fire&mdash;At
twelve I rode to Mr Taylors two miles; he was out, I sat half an
hour with Miss Taylor &amp; returned to Dinner, the Ride exceeding
pleasant, and my Horse seems (as jockeys say) in good Flesh &amp; well
prepar'd for our approaching &amp; much wished for Journey&mdash;Evening
Mr <i>Simpson</i> came in, sup'd &amp; stays the Night. He has last Week,
been destilling Mr Carter's Liquor made of Pisimonds&mdash;it is soft,
mild, of a fair pure Colour, burns clear, but does not answer the
Colonels Expectations; so that he does not propose to recommend it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to his Neighbours in this or the Neighbouring Counties as a useful
experiment. When call'd on for my Toast, at Supper I gave Miss
<i>Jenny Corbin</i>; Mrs <i>Carter</i> gave Captain <i>Lee</i>; &amp; Mr <i>Simpson</i> gave
Miss <i>Jones</i>.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 29.</i></p>

<p>To warm to day for fire, but we have the wind very strong from the
West&mdash;Mr <i>Carter</i> rode to Court&mdash;Soon after Breakfast I receiv'd a
Letter from Mr <i>Andrew Bryan</i> of Baltimore, Maryland formerly at
College my Class-Mate&mdash;the Letter bears Date January 21st 1774
Dated at <i>Baltimore</i>. He informs me of his good Health, &amp; that, he
shall soon forward my Letters inclosed to him; perhaps kind oppertunity
shall have before this hour favoured my wish, &amp; brought
to Laura advices of my State&mdash;At twelve I rode out, with Ben, an
hour &amp; better, the Day vastly windy. About four Colonel Philip Lee's
Chariot arrived, in which came four young Misses to be ready for
the Dance which happens here tomorrow&mdash;I am informed this Evening
that Smith the Villian mentioned last Sunday was to day apprehended,
&amp; committed to the prison in this County</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span><i>Wednesday 30.</i></p>

<p>Rainy &amp; cold&mdash;The Colonel informed me this morning that the
general Opinion of the Gentlemen at Court yesterday seem'd to be
that the County would be free'd of three Villians if the old abused
Father, the wounded Son &amp; Brother, &amp; the offending guilty Son were
to be all hanged&mdash;The Day so bad Mr <i>Christian</i> does not attend&mdash;Mrs
<i>Washington</i> came however, with Miss Jenny her Daughter; the
two Fantleroys came also, &amp; Miss Corbin, &amp; Miss Turburville, &amp;
one Miss Hale<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> a new <i>Scholar</i>&mdash;Mr Carters Man play'd &amp; the
Dance goes on with great Spirit &amp; neatness. Evening there is as common
a good play. Separated all for Bed by half after nine.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 31.</i></p>

<p>All our company continue. The morning fair &amp; cool&mdash;Yesterday &amp;
to-day I am strongly solicited to dance&mdash;I decline however &amp; must
persevere.&mdash;Mr &amp; Mrs Turburville came in before Dinner&mdash;With
the two Fantleroys, Ben, Bob, &amp; Harry, I had a pleasant walk
through the Fields, to the Mill &amp;c. I paid my forfeit to the Baker
7&frac12;d&mdash;The Plumb-Trees are beginning to blossom&mdash;Towards Evening
our company all left us.</p>


<p><i>Fryday April 1st 1774.</i></p>

<p>Good Fryday&mdash;A general Holiday here&mdash;Wednesday &amp; thursday I
gave up my School on account of the Dance, and they must have
this Day for Devotion!&mdash;The Colonel, <i>Ben Harry</i>, &amp; <i>myself</i> all go to
Ucomico Church&mdash;Parson <i>Smith</i> gave the usual Prayers for the Day
and a long Sermon very suitable &amp; well chosen.</p>

<p>After Service we were invited and went Home with Captain
Walker to dine; I was here introduced to Dr Steptoe<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> &amp; a young
Gentleman Brother to the Parson Both seem agreeable, &amp; appear to
be men of Sense Dined here also the Parson, his Wife, Sister, Mr
Warder the Lawyer</p>

<p>Towards Evening we rode home I observed as I rode along People
are universally plowing up their Land for planting Corn &amp; for Tobacco
And in one field I saw several Women planting Corn I think
however, it is early even here&mdash;They raise no Flax, their Land in general
being so poor that it will not produce it&mdash;And their Method of
farming is slovenly, without any regard to continue their Land in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
heart, for future Crops&mdash;They plant large Quantities of Land, without
any Manure, &amp; work it very hard to make the best of the Crop,
and when the Crop comes off they take away the Fences to inclose
another Piece of Land for the next years tillage, and leave this a common
to be destroyed by Winter &amp; Beasts till they stand in need of it
again to plough&mdash;The Land most commonly too is of a light sandy
soil, &amp; produces in very great quantities shrubby <i>Savins</i> &amp; <i>Pines</i>, unless
in the Vallies (for it is very hilly) &amp; near the Potowmack where
it is often vastly rich&mdash;Mr Carter has been lately solicited &amp; was to
have gone this Day with a number of Gentlemen to Horn-Point on
the River Ucomico, with an intention, if they think the Situation will
be proper, to establish Ware-Houses, &amp; form a small Town&mdash;It is
however, in my opinion, a fruitless Scheme&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 2.</i></p>

<p>The morning stormy. I kept the children in til twelve o-Clock then
dismissed them&mdash;I spent the greater part of this Day in reading Miscellaneous
Pieces out of Magazines&mdash;The weather cleared before
Evening&mdash;At five with <i>Ben</i>, I rode over to Mr Turburville's, chiefly
to see a young Lady<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> lately from London; who has come over at
Mr Turburville's Invitation in the character of Governess to Miss
Turburville She seems to be young, genteel, &amp; is not without personal
excellence&mdash;I received together with Mr <i>Carters</i> Family an Invitation
from Mr Turburville to dine with him to morrow; which I
propose to accept.&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 3.</i></p>

<p>The Day pleasant; I rode to church&mdash;after the Service proper for
the Day, Mr Smith entertained us with a Sermon from Pauls Defence
before King Agrippa "How is it thought a thing impossible with you
that God should raise the dead," He in this gave us a very plain &amp;
just Discourse on the doctrine of the resurection&mdash;This being Easter-Sunday,
all the Parish seem'd to meet together High, Low, black,
White all come out&mdash;After Sermon the Sacrament was administered,
but none are admited except communicants to see how the matter
is conducted&mdash;</p>

<p>After Sermon I rode to Mr Turburville's (for I found to day the
true spelling of his name) There dined with him, Ladies Mrs <i>Carter</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
&amp; Mrs <i>George Turburville</i>: Gentlemen, Colonel <i>Carter</i>, Squire-<i>Lee</i>,
Mr <i>Cunningham</i>, &amp; Mr <i>Jennings</i>, Merchants; Mr <i>George Lee</i>, &amp; <i>Ben
Carter</i> &amp; Myself&mdash;We had an elegant dinner; Beef &amp; Greens; roast-Pig;
fine boil'd Rock-Fish, Pudding, Cheese &amp;c&mdash;Drink: good Porter-Beer,
Cyder, Rum, &amp; Brandy Toddy. The Virginians are so kind
one can scarce know how to dispense with, or indeed accept their
kindness shown in such a variety of instances.&mdash;I had again an oppertunity
of seeing Miss <i>Sally Panton</i> which is the name of Mrs Turburville's
English Governess&mdash;But the common voice seems to be
against me as to her being Handsome&mdash;But her huge <i>Stays</i> low Head
<i>dress</i>; enormous long <i>Waist</i>, a Dress entirely contrary to the liking
of Virginia Ladies, these I apprehend make her in their Eyes less personable,
than to any one wholly unprejudiced&mdash;Her <i>Stays</i> are suited
to come up to the upper part of her shoulders, almost to her chin;
and are swaithed round her as low as they can possibly be, allowing
Her the liberty to walk at all: To be sure this is a vastly modest
Dress!&mdash;She speaks French &amp; is to teach the Language to Miss Turburville,
&amp; also Writing, &amp; reading English&mdash;Upon the whole, if her
Principles of Religion, &amp; her moral behaviour, be as unexceptionable
as her person, &amp; her Manner, let Mr and Mrs Carters opinions go
again me I shall think her agreeable&mdash;Miss <i>Prissy</i> Miss <i>Nancy</i>; &amp;
Miss <i>Fanny</i> all stay the night at Captain Turburville's&mdash;At Church,
Mr Low, a young Scotch Gentleman, tutor in Colonel <i>Washingtons</i>
Family, solicited me to carry his Recommendations from Scotland,
to Dr Witherspoon as he is desirous to be licensed in one of our
northern Presbyteries&mdash;I shall do him the Favour.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>&mdash;The country
begins to put on her Fowery Garment, &amp; appear in <i>gaity</i>&mdash;The <i>Apricots</i>
are in their fulles Bloom; Peaches also, &amp; Plumbs, &amp; several sorts
of Cheries are blossoming; as I look from my Window &amp; see Groves
of Peach Trees on the Banks of Nomini; (for the orchards here are
very Large) and other Fruit Trees in Blossom; and amongst them
interspers'd the gloomy Savin; beyond all these at a great Distance the
blue Potowmack; &amp; over this great River, just discern the Woods
of Maryland &amp; conceive that beyond them all lies Cohansie my native
pleasant Residence; &amp; when I think with myself that by Gods permission,
in a very few days more I shall be in the midst of Society,
quite remote from formality, and from the least fear of giving offence
by being familiar, or of being aw'd to silence by ostentatious
vanity: how the thought fires me! Direct my Way, merciful God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and keep my Feet from falling, &amp; my Heart from disobeying thy
pure &amp; perfect commandments&mdash;And make my Way prosperous
that I may go and return again, still doing thy Pleasure, &amp; honouring
thy great Name!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Monday 4.</i></p>

<p>Easter Monday; a general holiday; Negroes now are all disbanded
till Wednesday morning &amp; are at Cock Fights through the County;
This morning I make a general payment First to Sam the Barber
8/2. Second to Tom the Hostler 7/6. third to Nelson who waits on
me /3&frac12;. Sum 15/11&frac12;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr &amp; Mrs <i>Carter</i>, with Mr <i>Cunningham</i> &amp; <i>Ben</i> (as Mr Cunningham
came home with us last Night) all rode to Day to Richmond
Court&mdash;I was in the morning strongly solicited to go, but chose to
decline it&mdash;After Breakfast, came home from Mr Turburville's our
young Ladies, they inform me that Miss Panton discovered a strong
inclination to be better acquainted with me; which indeed is a
Curiosity that I cannot say I am altogether destitute of. I shall therefore,
when I find it convenient make Miss Panton a visit&mdash;</p>

<p>I was before Dinner very strongly urged, by Mr Taylor, Mr
Randolph, &amp; some others to attend a Cock-Fight, where 25 Cocks are
to fight, &amp; large Sums are betted, so large at one as twenty five
Pounds, but I choose rather to stay at Home. I read to day, &amp; am
much charmed with a Speech of <i>Plato's</i> over Alexander the <i>Great</i>
lying dead before him&mdash;"O thou, who deceived by vain-Glory didst
think of grasping at every thing, others are now going to gather the
fruits of thy labours &amp; thy Fatigues. Of so many conquests, there remains
of thee but the terrible account, which thou art obliged to
render unto the sovereign Judge"!&mdash;</p>

<p>I have also to Day with considerable attention been looking over
Junius's Letters. His sentiments are strong, &amp; bold. His language is
chaste, &amp; concise. &amp; his Genius seems free and vast&mdash;I cannot easily
omit transcribing a short passage from his Letter to the Revd Mr
<i>Horne</i> in which he is speaking of Lord <i>Chatham</i>. as it pleases me
vastly. "As for the common, sordid views of avarice, or any purpose
of vulgar Ambition, I question whether the applause of <i>Junius</i>, would
be of service to Lord Chatham. My vote will hardly recommend him
to an increase of his pension, or to a Seat in the Cabinet. But if his
Ambition be upon a levil with his understanding&mdash;If he judges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
what is truely honourable for himself with the same superior Genius
which animates &amp; directs him to Eloquence in Debates, to Wisdom
in Decision, even the Pen of <i>Junius</i> shall contribute to reward him.
Recorded Honour shall gather round his Monument, &amp; thicken over
him. It is a solid Fabric, &amp; will support the Lawrels that adorn it&mdash;I
am not conversant in the language of panegyric&mdash;These praises are
extorted from me; but they will wear well, for they have been dearly
earned."&mdash;</p>

<p>Junius, however, does not seem to have been at all ignorant of his
own merit; for in the close of the same letter he says "Such Artifices
cannot long delude the understanding of the People; &amp;, without
meaning an indecent Comparison I may venture to foretell, that
the <i>Bible</i> &amp; <i>Junius</i> will be read when the Commentaries of the Jesuits
are forgotten. We supped at nine&mdash;Mr Carter tired and early in Bed.</p>

<p>After Supper I had a long conversation with Mrs Carter concerning
Negroes in Virginia, &amp; find that She esteems their value at no
higher rate than I do. We both concluded, (&amp; I am pretty certain
that the conclusion is just) that if in Mr Carters, or in any Gentlemans
Estate, all the Negroes should be sold, &amp; the Money put to Interest
in safe hands, &amp; let the Lands which these Negroes now work
lie wholly uncultivated, the bare Interest of the Price of the Negroes
would be a much greater yearly income than what is now received
from their working the Lands, making no allowance at all for the
trouble &amp; Risk of the Masters as to the Crops, &amp; Negroes.&mdash;How
much greater then must be the value of an Estate here if these poor
enslaved Africans were all in their native desired Country, &amp; in their
Room industrious Tenants, who being born in freedom, by a laudable
care, would not only inrich their Landlords, but would raise a
hardy Offspring to be the Strength &amp; the honour of the Colony.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 5.</i></p>

<p>It is with difficulty I am able to collect the members of our School
together for Business. Holidays have become habitual, &amp; they seem
unwilling to give them over. As the Negroes have this Day for a
Holiday our Schollars thinks it hard that they should be compell'd
to attend to Business. I summon them together however, and shall
keep them to constant Study until the time of my setting away. Miss
Priscilla this morning told me, of Miss Panton, a moving story: Last
Sunday Evening after we left there She took a lonely Walk, &amp; being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
asked why She chose to walk without a companion, she answered
that she was thinking of Home &amp; of her Friends, &amp; indulging her fond
Grief on account of their absence!&mdash;Such a feeling as this I have
not been a stranger to, I therefore Sympathize with the poor young
Girl. The Day agreeably pleasant&mdash;Towards Evening Miss <i>Corbin</i>
came over to pay us a visit After School I waited on the Ladies in the
Dining-Room the conversation was on Fashions, which instantly introduced
the oddity of Miss <i>Panton</i>. But Miss Corbin with a <i>Sneer</i>,
&amp; with ill-nature enough, swore She would not think of imitating
such a thing as her!&mdash;O!&mdash;Tantam Animis clestibus Ir?&mdash;I spent
the Evening in cheerful chat with the Ladies. I think I have not had
a more sociable &amp; unconstrained feeling since I left Home, &amp; my
forgiving Friends.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 6.</i></p>

<p>Ben is making a great Bustle about going to Philadelphia&mdash;He almost
counts the Hours&mdash;We propose to go next Wednesday. But with
composure, &amp; Patience, yet with great Satisfaction I anticipate the
near approaching Day. <i>Ben</i> begs me to acquaint him with the manners
of the People in regard to Religion, and he swears he can suit
himself to any serious, or formal Visage&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <i>Carter</i>, &amp; Miss <i>Corbin</i>, after Breakfast rode to Colonel Frank-Lee's&mdash;We
dine alone. I informed the Colonel that I do not think it
will be convenient for me to continue with him longer than one
year&mdash;He discovered some dissattisfaction; I told him my reason &amp; he
assented&mdash;he honours me, by putting in me so much confidence as to
commission me to find out and recommend to Him some young
Gentleman to succeed me in the instruction of his Children&mdash;He
flattered my vanity also by reading a Letter to me which I am to
bear to Dr Witherspoon, the contents of it as follows&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Robert <i>Carters</i> compliments to Dr <i>Witherspoon</i>: He has the
pleasure to acquaint Him that Mr Fithians Method of teaching, &amp; his
conduct are highly approved here; He is about to visit his friends
in <i>New-Jersey</i>, &amp; will bring these from Sir,</p>

<p class="center">
Your humble Servt"&mdash;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>He informed me that he does indeed prefer a Tutor for his Children
who has been educated upon the Continent, not on a supposition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
such are better Schollars, or that they are of better principles, or of
more agreeable Tempers; but only on account of pronunciation in
the English Language, (as most of his Children are to be taught
chiefly in this) in which he allows young Gentlemen educated in
good Schools on the Continent, to excel the Scotch young Gentlemen,
&amp; indeed most of the English.&mdash;Evening came in &amp; staid the
Night Captain Blackwell.</p>

<p><i>Thursday 7.</i></p>


<p>Breakfasted with us Miss <i>Corbin</i>. The Day pleasant&mdash;Mr Carter proposes
to set away soon after Dinner&mdash;He seems, however, to prepare
himself for his Journey with all the sedateness of a philosopher&mdash;Besides
the Commands he gave me yesterday, he desires me to wait
on Mr Willing<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Merchant in Philadelphia &amp; know if he will trade
here for either Flour or Bread in any Quantity.&mdash;He has given Ben
&amp; me an Invitation to ride &amp; spend this Evening with him at Colonel
<i>Tayloe's</i>&mdash;We set out about three; Mr <i>Carter</i> travels in a small, neat
<i>Chair</i>, with two waiting Men&mdash;We rode across the Country which
is now in full Bloom; in every field we saw Negroes planting Corn,
or plowing, or hoeing; we arrived at the Colonels about five, Distance
twelve miles. Here is an elegant Seat!&mdash;The House is about the Size
of Mr. <i>Carters</i>, built with Stone, &amp; finished curiously, &amp; ornamented
with various paintings, &amp; rich Pictures. This Gentleman owns <i>Yorick</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
who won the prize of 500 last November, from Dr Floods Horse
<i>Gift</i>&mdash;In the Dining-Room, besides many other fine Pieces, are
twenty four of the most celebrated among the English Race-Horses,
Drawn masterly, &amp; set in elegant gilt Frames.&mdash;He has near the great
House, two fine two story stone Houses, the one is used as a Kitchen,
&amp; the other, for a nursery, &amp; Lodging Rooms&mdash;He has also a large
well formed, beautiful Garden, as fine in every Respect as any I have
seen in <i>Virginia</i>. In it stand four large beautiful Marble Statues&mdash;From
this House there is a good prospect of the River <i>Rapahannock</i>,
which opposite here is about two miles across; We can also from the
chambers easily see the Town Hobbes-Hole &amp; the Ships which lie
there. I was introduced by Mr <i>Carter</i> to the Colonel, to Miss Polly,
&amp; to Miss Kitty his Daughters&mdash;&amp; to a Lady (Mrs Thornton,)<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> that
happened there, &amp; to a young Gentleman, Mr Corvin<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>&mdash;The young
Ladies played several tunes for us, &amp; in good Taste on the <i>Harpsichord</i>;
We supp'd at nine; &amp; had the usual Toasts.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 8.</i></p>

<p>The Ladies before breakfast gave us several tunes on the Harpsichord&mdash;About
ten Mr Carter set out for <i>Williamsburg</i>, to the general
Court, which sits twice a year, each Time twenty four Days Sundays
excluded&mdash;We had some agreeable Conversation this morning;
Horses seem to be the Colonels favourite topic&mdash;He inquired of me
however, where I was born; where educated; &amp; if I am pleased with
<i>Virginia</i>&mdash;He told me he saw Dr Witherspoon, &amp; conversed with
him an Evening last Fall, &amp; is much pleased with his manner, &amp; Qualities&mdash;He
informed me that Dr <i>Morgan</i><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> of Philadelphia breakfasted
with him a few Days ago; he calls the Docter facetious, sensible, &amp;

undoubted ability to teach in a Family&mdash;I shall apply to Mr <i>Saml

Leave about Eleven, and returned Home&mdash;The Day is cloudy and
cold, the wind hard at North, &amp; threatens Snow&mdash;This evening Ben
met with a sad repulse; Mrs <i>Carter</i> proposes going to Williamsburg
soon, &amp; says She must have his company! Poor Boy, he feels the Force
of Disappointment! And I confess I am a little vexed&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 9.</i></p>

<p>Mrs Carter gave Ben liberty to go with me as far as Anopolis, provided
we set out soon, &amp; accordingly we propose to set off to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>

<p><i>Sunday 10.</i></p>

<p>Mrs <i>Carter</i> yesterday, in the Character of a truely fond Mother, altered
her mind concerning <i>Ben</i> many Times and in several different
manners: At first she agreed for him to go with me as far as Anopolis
without a waiting Man; then She concluded he was not well and had
better decline going entirely; towards Evening She gave him full liberty
if he will take a Waiting-Man; &amp; will not set away till Monday
morning; This I urged not being pleased from the Begining with
going on the Sabbath&mdash;I gave yesterday to the Shoemaker a Bit&mdash;&amp;
a Bit to the Wash woman; half a Bit to her little Girl; &amp; half a Bit to
<i>Nelson</i> the Boy who waits on our School; the whole is 11&frac12;. This
morning is extremely pleasant the Country full of Flowers, &amp; the
branches full of lovely singing Birds.&mdash;Before Breakfast, I saw a Ring
of Negroes at the Stable, fighting Cocks, and in several parts of the
plantation they are digging up their small Lots of ground allow'd by
their Master for Potatoes, peas &amp;c; All such work for themselves they
constantly do on Sundays, as they are otherwise employed on every
other Day. Sermon to Day, is at Ucomico, too far for my Horse immediately
before his Journey&mdash;Neither Mrs <i>Carter</i> nor any of the
Family go&mdash;At Dinner I received a Letter from Mr <i>Lowe</i>, with his
Testimonials from the College in Edinburg which I am to present to
the Presbytery of Philadelphia and if it shall be accepted, I am to
bring such Exercises as they may appoint&mdash;</p>

moderate at North West but the boat is aground, &amp; I must wait until

Mortal Winter!</p>


<p><i>Sunday 17.</i></p>

<p>The morning vastly pleasant &amp; Cohansie looks a delightsome as ever
it used I went to meeting. How unlike <i>Virginia</i>, no rings of Beaux
chatting before &amp; after Sermon on Gallantry; no assembling in
crowds after Service to dine &amp; bargain; no cool, spiritless harangue
from the Pulpit; Minister &amp; people here seem in some small measure
to reverence the Day, there neither do the one or the other&mdash;I spent
the day at Home.</p>


<p><i>Monday 18.</i></p>

<p>I took a tour over to Town before dinner to see old acquaintances
The Neighbourhood looks in nothing altered Mr <i>Potter</i> took home

<p><i>Saturday 23.</i></p>

<p>At home drawing off some of Mr Lyons Tunes, &amp; revising my own

much Conversation on music, he is vastly fond of music &amp; musical
genius's We spent the Evening with great sattisfaction to me</p>


<p><i>Sunday 24.</i></p>

<p>I left Mr Hunters Early I wrote a line to Miss Beatty, for a excuse
for not seeing her yesterday Attended Sermon at Greenwich. I rode
in the Evening to the Bridge to hear Mr Green, my old, much respected
Tutor preach, he came &amp; delivered himself admirably without
making Use of Notes at all I staid the Night at Mr Seeleys, visited
Mrs Ramsey, &amp; Dr Elmer &amp; spoke with many of my acquaintances&mdash;</p>

the Beginning &amp; continuation of the quarrel of the Magistrates-freeholders,

Holinsheads by eight o Clock&mdash;Returned home by twelve.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 4.</i></p>

<p>Last night &amp; this morning fell a very considerable Snow, so much
that I imagine had it not melted after it fell it would have been six
inches deep! Afternoon I walked to Deerfield&mdash;Miss Beatty a little&mdash;thoughtful.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 5.</i></p>

<p>At the Bridge before noon to agree with Mr Potter about taking my
Brother Amos prentice&mdash;We put it off some Days&mdash;Expence for a

<p>Still very cold. To Day is the fast before Sacrament. Mr Hunter gave

must be past recovery, probably. the Flax too.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 7.</i></p>

<p>I did several errands for myself in Greenwich&mdash;Before Noon Mr
Patterson call'd to see me; He is shortly to be married to Miss Amy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Ewing&mdash;She is a Girl of Reading, Taste, &amp; Delicacy; has a good
share of personal Beauty, open, sociable, &amp; kind in her manner, &amp; on
the whole agreeable&mdash;Mr Paterson seemed always to me formal, has
a peculiar, universal Fondness for the Fair is a great mathematician,
a good English Scholar &amp; Philosopher, &amp; is frugal &amp; industrious. I
rode with Mr Patterson to Mr Hunters, he informed me many
things concerning the new School or small Acadamy lately instituted
at Wilmington, in which he is second Master. Evening I wrote
a sentimental Letter to Miss <i>Beatty</i>.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 8.</i></p>

<p>To day at Greenwich was administred, &amp; I received the holy Sacrament&mdash;Grant,
great God, that I may have been a worthy communicant!
I dined with Mrs Ward. She speaks with great Respect,
Affection, and Sincerity of her late worthy Partner.</p>


<p><i>Monday 9.</i></p>

<p>Til Eleven I am busy in looking over Exercises for the approaching
Presbytery. After Dinner I made Mrs Brewster a Visit. Mr Ben Peck
in my opinion is rashly entering on an important matter; he is going
to begin in a few Days the Study of Phisic under the direction of
Dr Bowen; whose kowledge &amp; Practice, by those who are in fact
Judges in the Art seems to be wholly exploded. There is a Report
that Mrs Brewster is in prospect of being married to a Gentleman
from Maryland; She talks freely of it, says She can fancy him; that
he is a man of Fortune, of character &amp; to her agreeable&mdash;But there
is one She regards more who has left her, however, without hope!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 10.</i></p>

<p>Yesterday, in a private lonely manner, at nine in the morning, were
married Mr Patterson &amp; Miss Amy Ewing. I wish them from my
heart a long, unbroken, &amp; strong friendship for each other, &amp; mutual,
unmixed happiness. After breakfast according to a previous appointment,
I rode to Deerfield Dine at Mrs Pecks. I am ashamed that I may
record here what does no honour to my old Aunt, I saw her with
three Partners round a Table playing Cards at that vulgar game fit
only for the meanest gamblers "all Fours"<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>&mdash;At three I visited
Miss <i>Beatty</i> that amiable Girl, I always see with pleasure, am happy
where She is &amp; feel uneasy &amp; disturbed always when I must leave her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Since June in the year 1770 I have had an acquaintance with her&mdash;&amp;
since May in the year 1771 I have happily had an Intimacy. Her
Goodness has at length indulged my importunate Solicitations &amp; in
her Society I hope to be happy&mdash;I spent the Evening til eleven with
her, &amp; in the most entertaining manner, Mr Howel &amp; Mr John Peck
call'd in a small Time.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 11.</i></p>

<p>I rose a little after seven. It is not my custom to lie in bed so long,
but I was with Lazy Boys, <i>Reading Beatty</i>, and <i>Stephen Ranney</i>.
Mrs Green is better, but Miss <i>Beatty</i> says she has the <i>Hipp</i>&mdash;Soon
after breakfast I returned Home&mdash;Mrs Pecks Family Mr Howel, &amp;
Miss Beatty at the same time set out on a visit to Mr Hoshels. There
came a report to Day that Mr Stephen Reeve Silver Smith of Philadelphia
is broken up, &amp; has left the City; disagreeable News this to
his Relations here&mdash;There was an Ox killed this Day at Bridge-Town
which weighed upwards of a thousand weight, supposed to be the

<p>It will not be wonderful if I inform you that this Colony is in
great tumult and confusion. The general Voice is <i>Boston</i>. You will
have heard before the reception of this, that the Governor dissolved
the Assembly in this province on their making a resolve to keep
the first day of June on which the Act of Parliament is to take place
at Boston, (excepting the days of grace) a solemn fast. The people
agree however in general to unite with the people of Boston and the
other northern trading Cities, and by their example to influence all
the Colonies, not to make any resistance to the Britains, but to keep
themselves independant, and refuse to receive their comodities, and
keep within themselves, their own more valuable comodities, because
they are for the support of life&mdash;So stedfast are the people here that
the Captain of a Ship belonging to an eminent house in London was
yesterday refused any more Tobacco til' there is intelligence from
the Northward&mdash;</p>

<p>The frost which happened the 4th. of May, was by far more severe
and fatal here than either in Maryland, New-Jersey, or Pennsylvania&mdash;The
expected produce of Gardens and Peaches, (which were
some planters chief dependance) are not only almost wholly destroy'd,
but in the upper parts of the province Wheat and Rye are
so much cut off that the owners think it best to mow it down for
fodder!&mdash;</p>

<p>I have the pleasure to inform you that I had a speedy and pleasant
ride; found the family in good health; that it is a time of general
health in the County&mdash;and that I am again agreeably settled to business&mdash;</p>

<p>Please to make my compliments to Mrs Hunter, Miss Nancy,
Andrew, and to Uncles family&mdash;I am, sir</p>

with great difficulty; they were for asserting their liberty. &amp; pleaded
the custom of las winter&mdash;I finished a rough incorrect plan of my
English Thesis, &amp; laid it by for future examination&mdash;</p>

<p>After dinner I begun the Lecture, wrote an introduction&mdash;Towards
evening I took my hat &amp; a Sermon, &amp; retired to a Shady Green
where I rambled about til dusk committing my Sermon to memory&mdash;We
have omitted Supper, &amp; in its place substituted Coffee which
we commonly take about seven in the evening&mdash;Ben, this Afternoon
rode to Colonel Frank Lee's. The ground is very dry; The Frost of
the fourth of May has been much more severe and fatal here than in
the northern colonies&mdash;The peaches here, except on Farms lying
near the Potowmack are wholly destroy'd, &amp; these were the choisest
expectation of some, who think Brandy their most valuable comodity!&mdash;And
I am told that in Louden, &amp; the other upper counties,
(which indeed are the best for grain) Wheat &amp; Rie are cut off, so
intirely that the owners mow it down for fodder!&mdash;And in these
lower Counties in many places the Woods appear like November, &amp;
the Leaves are actually dropping!&mdash;To be sure it is unusual &amp; melancholy!&mdash;</p>

pleasant is retirement! And how easy is it to enjoy it&mdash;This may
seem strange, but it is true&mdash;I have but very few acquaintances, &amp;
they easily dispense with my Absence&mdash;I have an elegant inviting

these put together, when they operate at once, are a strong incitement
to divert me from Study. Yet I love Cohansie! And in spite
of my resolution, when I am convinced that my situation is more advantageous
here, yet I wish to be there&mdash;How exceedingly capricious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

with one another&mdash;I have just spoken in praise of Society &amp;
retirement; And I now observe we are of such a make that, if we be
happy, these must alternately succeed each other&mdash;It is something
like the opinion of <i>Socrates</i> concerning pleasure &amp; pain, that if we
possess the one, we may expect it will not be long before we shall
meet with the other&mdash;Towards evening At Mrs Carters request I

conversation with Mrs Carter She told me openly &amp; candidly
the Several failings of her children, &amp; indeed She knows them perfectly&mdash;In
particular she knows not what to do with her perverse
Son <i>Bob</i>&mdash;He abuses his Mama, Miss Sally, the children, Family,
and is much given to slander. Poor unhappy youth, I fear he will
come to an unhappy end! This afternoon I found it necessary to
correct Bob severely for impertinence in School&mdash;Mr Carter at
Court received his Invoice from London for this Spring, in which
was a gold Seal for <i>Ben</i> with a Coat of Arms price five Guineas!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 7.</i></p>

<p>The morning pleasant, cool &amp; agreeable&mdash;I corrected Harry this
morning for telling me a Lie&mdash;Stomachful &amp; sullen as any youth&mdash;The
day warm but very bearable&mdash;Breakfasted with us Mr Blain &amp;
Mr Warden, all the conversation is Politicks; But People seem
moderate &amp; yet settled in their determinations to stand out</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><i>Wednesday 8.</i></p>

<p>The morning pleasant&mdash;Mr <i>Carter</i> rode to the Ucomiko Ware-houses
to examine in the Shipping some of his Tobacco&mdash;We have
no Company. The day is very warm&mdash;A flaming sultry Sun, a dusty
scorched Ground, Mr <i>Carter</i> returned, the day being smoky introduced,
at Coffee, a conversation on Philosophy, on Eclipses; the manner
of viewing them; Thence to Telescopes, &amp; the information which
they afforded us of the Solar System; Whether the planets be actually
inhabited &amp;c.</p>

<p>After I acquaint you that, by the kindness of providence I arrived
safe and am in good health, I shall not neglect to inform you that the
Virginians are warm and active in supporting the liberties of America;
the first day of June throughout this Colony, by a resolve of the
House of Burgesses, or Assembly of Representatives for the province
was kept a solemn Fast, and kept religiously too, to invoke almighty
God to assist our falling country, and save us from oppression and
Tyranny&mdash;The ware-Houses are already hindring the Shipping Tobacco,
and it is expected there will shortly be a general embargo
laid on all exportable commodities&mdash;The people here wish for the
union of all the Colonies, and for firm perseverance in what shall
seem most conducive to the good of America, notwithstanding this
Colony and Maryland will suffer vastly, because Tobacco is a comodity
less saleable among ourselves than most of the produce of the
Northern Colonies, and it is in these the staple&mdash;</p>

<p>I am seated once more to great sattisfaction in my business, the
family and neighbourhood are well, but I propose and expect by the
permission of providence to return home the latter end of October;
in the mean time, I am,</p>

<p><i>Thursday 9.</i></p>

<p>The morning haizy, no Wind, &amp; very warm&mdash;I wrote a Letter to
Uncle <i>Samuel Fithian</i>&mdash;After Dinner Mr Carter set out for Williamsburg&mdash;by
him I sent to the Post-office at <i>Hobbes-Hole</i>, My
Letters to Mr <i>Hunter</i>, Uncle <i>Fithian</i>, Miss <i>Beatty</i>. &amp; Mr <i>Peck</i>&mdash;After
School in the evening I had an agreeable walk with Mrs <i>Carter</i>
in the Garden&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fryday 10.</i></p>

<p>Cool but exceeding dry&mdash;Writing at my Lecture. Mrs <i>Carter</i> was to
day sadly frighted with a Lizard, that lives under the House&mdash;After
School, with Ben I wakked over to Mr Turburville's to gather
Cheries, which are there in great plenty&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i> in the evening
after our return, gave me a Lecture for taking <i>Ben</i> to <i>Annapolis</i> when
I went last Home without a waiting-Man&mdash;Wrote at my Lecture
til eleven. Ben sleeps at the Great-House in the absence of his <i>Papa</i>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><i>Saturday 11.</i></p>

<p>I was sitting in the Colonels Library I took a Catalogue of the whole
of His Books&mdash;&amp; he tells me he has left behind him at Williamsburg,
with many other things 458 volumes besides Music &amp; Pamphlets.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>It is with considerable Difficulty that I keep the Children in School
til twelve o Clock as they used to go out all the last winter at Breakfast&mdash;<i>Bob</i>
especially is vastly vociferous on the Occasion&mdash;Our Bells
for School &amp; play-Hours are at present under good Regulations. The
Children come in as soon as they rise and are Drest which is usually
about seven&mdash;The Bell rings at eight for Breakfast&mdash;At nine it Rings
for two purposes; for the Children to enter School, &amp; for the Gardiners,
Carpenters, &amp; other workmen to come into Breakfast&mdash;At ten it
Rings them to work. At twelve it rings for the School play hours&mdash;At
two it rings for us to Dine, &amp; the workmen&mdash;And the las[t] bell
is at three for School &amp; for the workmen to go to Labour&mdash;I dismiss
them by my watch at half after Five.&mdash;After Dinner I rode alone to
Mr Blains Store; bought a pen-knife, nine Jacket-Buttons, &amp; a primmer
for Miss <i>Harriot 3/</i>. It is alarming to observe how hard, &amp; dusty
the Country is; towards evening some clouds arose &amp; looked promising
in the West, but they bring no rain&mdash;No rain has fell here since
the 24th of May, &amp; then but a Scanty Shower, &amp; most of the time
since windy.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 12.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> &amp; Mr <i>Randolph</i> had a small wrangle about Horses: The Day is
vastly hot, the wind small at West, clear &amp; very Dry I choose therefore
to stay at Home&mdash;I lent my Horse to <i>Ben</i>, &amp; staid myself at
Home to write my Lecture, Mrs <i>Carter</i> the two Misses, &amp; Ben went
to Church, Mr Randolph went on Board Captain Blackwells Ship to
dine&mdash;<i>Bob</i> pleaded hard with me for Leave to go on Board the Ship,
but I kept him at home with me&mdash;Evening I finished my Lecture &amp;
laid it by for future examination. Some Clouds &amp; Lightning in the
west but no rain.</p>

<p>Monday 13.</p>

<p><i>Ben</i> gave <i>Bob</i>, for some imprudent Language a drubbing this morning&mdash;About
nine we had a Shower but soon over &amp; of little use; be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to God, however, that we have any&mdash;I begun, to day my Sermon
for the Presbytery&mdash;The change in the weather since yesterday is
remarkable. This afternoon is so cool that I should be glad of a
winter suit&mdash;yesterday afternoon was so hot I could not be comfortably
cool in a thin gown, with all the windows of my chamber
up. Evening, John the waiting Man play'd, &amp; the young Ladies spent
the evening merrily in dancing&mdash;I staid til ten, saw them &amp; Conversed
with Mrs Carter.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 14.</i></p>

<p>I added last night to my Bed-Clothes a Quilt, Blanket, &amp; my own
Clothes &amp; lay under them all, none too warm&mdash;The children call'd
for a Fire in the school-Room, &amp; were so cold I was obliged to dismiss
them before the Bell&mdash;I believe there is no Frost&mdash;Befor Breakfast,
Mr <i>Stadley</i> the musician came from Colonel <i>Taylors</i> at <i>mount
Airy</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Priscilla &amp; Nancy attend his instructions. Mr Stadley shewed me
some Verses he is carrying from Mr Washingtons to His Daughter
they seem good and are as follow.</p>

<p>Spent the evening very agreeably with Mrs Carter &amp; Mr Stadley, we
sat about a good Fire in the Dining-Room, and it seems as necessary
&amp; agreeable as in November or December.&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><i>Wednesday 15.</i></p>

<p>So cold that I ordered a Fire in the School-Room&mdash;Mr Stadley with
us yet&mdash;I took out of the Library to read for entertainment the
"Amusement of the <i>German Spa</i>; it is a well written piece&mdash;Designed
entirely for Amusement Before dinner Mrs Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> with
her two Daughters Miss Polly, &amp; Kitty came in a Chariot&mdash;<i>Bob</i> was
in a moment on Fire; He is deeply Smitten with Polly's Charms&mdash;beg'd
me for Leave to go out of School &amp; dress&mdash;I allow'd him, The
Day was vastly windy &amp; the drouth is alarming!&mdash;Close Attention
for two weeks past has fatigued me so much, that yesterday, &amp; to
Day I have laid aside Study, &amp; read only for Relaxation&mdash;I took a
whim in my head &amp; would not go to Dinner, my Head was not
dress'd, &amp; I was too lazy to change my clothes&mdash;Mrs Carter, however,
in the evening lash'd me severely. I told her I was engaged in reading
a pleasant Novel.&mdash;That I was not perfectly well&mdash;But She would
not hear none, &amp; said I was rude, &amp; censurable&mdash;Mr Stadley spent the
evening in playing several songs &amp; Sonata's on the Harpsichord &amp; violin&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 16.</i></p>

<p>Mr Stadley left us before Breakfast&mdash;Reading at the Amusement of
<i>Spa</i>&mdash;Drew off some Tunes&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 17.</i></p>

<p>Bob was missing last night I was at his Room at twelve o Clock he
was absent&mdash;This morning I examined him, he told me he was at
Mr Turburville's, but told me several palpable Lies&mdash;I gave him however
severe correction&mdash;We had this morning about 5 o Clock a
smart Gust of wind, Rain &amp; Thunder, but soon over.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 18.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> not very well&mdash;At twelve <i>Bob</i> teaz'd me for leave to go to a
Cock-Fight &amp; Horse-Race about two Miles off, I gave him Leave
with his promising to be home by Sun Set.&mdash;Spent the Afternoon in
my room writing&mdash;Towards evening 'Squire <i>Lee</i> call'd in, &amp; brought
a late London News-Paper in which we are informed that another
Act of Parliament has pass'd taking from the People of Boston all
power of trying any Soldier, or Person whether for commiting any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Crime; &amp; obliging all such offenders to be sent home for legal Tryal&mdash;Heaven
only knows where these tumults will End!&mdash;He informed
us likewise that last Saturday in Richmond (our neighbour County)
the people drest &amp; burnt with great marks of Destestation the infamous
Lord <i>North</i>&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i>, after the 'Squire left us quite
astonished me in the Course of the evening. with her perfect acquaintance
with the American Constitution&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 19.</i></p>

<p>The day cool&mdash;Sermon is at Ucomico, so that we all stay at Home
Mrs Carter was in the morning frightned thinking that several of the
Negro-Girls in the Family are unwell with the Measles, but I believe
it to be only a Frett of the Heat Ben is unwel; He has a sick
Stomach; at Times aguish; complains of Pains in his Breast &amp; Side;
&amp; in the morning Spits Blood. He keeps about however, but his fond
Mama discovers great anxiety.&mdash;I spend the Day in my Room writing
at my Sermon, &amp; reading the plain &amp; useful <i>Pictete</i>.</p>


<p><i>Monday 20.</i></p>

<p>So cool that I sit with my Cloths buttoned, &amp; am chilly. the children
also complain of the cold; this must certainly be unwholesome
weather&mdash;Breakfasted with us Mr <i>Cox</i>&mdash;Ben continues no better,
he lays by Study to day &amp; keeps in&mdash;I myself either conceit or in
reality have a Fever &amp; head-Ach to Day&mdash;Before twelve we had a
moderate Shower no wind nor Thunder&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i> wrote a note
to Dr <i>Jones</i> &amp; Desired him to call &amp; See <i>Ben</i>, towards evening he
came; He thinks <i>Ben</i> has only Symptoms of an Agu approaching&mdash;He
prescribed some Physick&mdash;Drank Coffee with us, &amp; went home
about six&mdash;I lightens in the North.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 21.</i></p>

<p>Harry is unwel, takes this morning Physick, and keeps his Room&mdash;Ben
is in the same way&mdash;<i>Priscilla</i> &amp; Nancy are practising Musick, so
that to Day we have only four in School&mdash;At five in the Evening,
Ben, <i>Prissy</i> &amp; I rode out on Horse back for exercise; before we returned
Captain <i>Dobby</i>, of the Ship <i>Susannah</i> an agreeable, sensible,
polite Gentleman came, &amp; 'Squire <i>Lee</i>&mdash;The conversation, at Coffee
was on American affairs, the 'Squire shew'd us one of Mr Dunlaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
papers,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> in which are accounts that the Northern Colonies are
zealous &amp; stedfast in resolutions to maintain their Liberties&mdash;We sat
til eleven&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 22.</i></p>

<p>Breakfasted with us Captain <i>Dobby</i>, &amp; Mr Taylor, their conversation
promiscuous&mdash;Clear &amp; warm, not sultry, <i>Harry</i> better &amp; in School,
but <i>Ben</i> continues indisposed. I wrote to Day some at my Sermon&mdash;After
School, with Mrs Carter &amp; the young Ladies &amp; <i>Bob</i>, I walked
through the Garden&mdash;But I seem not suited in being confin'd wholly
at Home, yet my stay is quite voluntary&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 23.</i></p>

<p>Very warm all the morning&mdash;From twelve to two I was writing at
my Sermon&mdash;While we were at dinner a very black cloud rose in
the West: Mrs Carter, is fearful when it thunders, so that I did not
leave the Room till it was over, about four, there was a strong Gale
of wind, some thunder, &amp; a refreshing Shower. At five with Mrs
Carter &amp; the young Ladies I took a walk; She shewed me from a
high Hill several beautiful Prospects&mdash;I was diverted tho it was a little
cruel, to see the Girls gather the Blossoms of some Prickly-Pears.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 24.</i></p>

<p>Lat night we had a Gust of Rain &amp; Thunder; very acceptable&mdash;To
Day in course Mr Christians Dance happens here&mdash;He came before
Breakfast&mdash;Miss <i>Jenny Washington</i> came also, &amp; Miss <i>Priscilla Hale</i>
while we were at Breakfast&mdash;Miss Washington is about seventeen;
She has not a handsome Face, but is neat in her Dress, of an agreeable
Size, &amp; well proportioned, &amp; has an easy winning Behaviour;
She is not forward to begin a conversation, yet when spoken to She
is extremely affable, without assuming any Girlish affectation, or pretending
to be overcharg'd with Wit; She has but lately had oppertunity
of Instruction in Dancing, yet She moves with propriety
when she dances a <i>Minuet</i> &amp; without any <i>Flirts</i> or vulgar <i>Capers</i>,
when She dances a <i>Reel</i> or <i>Country-Dance</i>: She plays well on the
Harpsichord, &amp; Spinet; understands the principles of Musick, &amp; therefore
performs her Tunes in perfect time, a Neglect of which always
makes music intolerable, but it is a fault almost universal among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>young Ladies in the practice; She sings likewise to her instrument,
has a strong, full voice, &amp; a well-judging Ear; but most of the Virginia-Girls
think it labour quite sufficient to thump the Keys of a
Harpsichord into the air of a tune mechanically, &amp; think it would be
Slavery to submit to the Drudgery of acquiring Vocal Music; Her
Dress is rich &amp; well-chosen, but not tawdry, nor yet too plain; She
appears to Day in a Chintz cotton Gown with an elegant blue Stamp,
a Sky-Blue silk Quilt, spotted apron; Her Hair is a light Brown, it
was crap'd up, with two Rolls at each Side, &amp; on the top a small cap
of beautiful Gawze and rich Lace, with an artificial Flower interwoven&mdash;Her
person &amp; carriage at a small distance resembles not a
little my much respected <i>Laura</i>. But on close examination her Features
are something masculine, those of <i>Laura</i> are mild and delicate:
Mr <i>Christien</i> very politely requested me to open the Dance by stepping
a Minuet with this amiable Girl, but I excused myself by assuring
Him that I never was taught to Dance.&mdash;Miss Hale is about fourteen;
a slim, puny silent Virgin; She has black Eyes, &amp; black Hair, a
good sett of Eye-Brows, which are esteem'd in Virginia essential to
Beauty; She looks innocent of every human Failing, does not speak
five Words in a Week, &amp; I dare say from her Carriage that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Modesty is invincible; She is drest in a white Holland Gown, cotton
Diaper quilt very fine, a Lawn apron, has her Hair crap'd up, &amp; on
it a small Tuft of Ribbon for a Cap She is but just innitiated into the
School, and only hobbles yet Once I saw her standing; I rose immediately
and begg'd her to accept my Chair; She answered most
kindly, "Sir I thank you." that was all I could extract from this
Wonder of the Sex for the two Days she stay'd, &amp; I seemed to have
an equal Share too in the Favours of her Conversation; so that I cannot
be any way particular in describing the mental faculties of Miss
<i>Hale</i>. it is sufficient to say that I think She is far removed from most
of the foibles of Women&mdash;Some time after these came Colonel
Lee's<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Chariot with five young Misses&mdash;These five, with Miss
Washington &amp; Miss Hale &amp; Miss Nancy Carter, &amp; Bob are Mr Christiens
Compliment of Scholars in this School except Miss Turburville
who is just now up the country with an Uncle, where She is to Stay
some time together with Miss Corbin. Miss Betsy Lee<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> is about
thirteen; a tall slim genteel Girl; She is very far from Miss Hale's
taciturnity, yet is by no means disagreeably forward; She dances extremely
well, &amp; is just begining to play the Spinet&mdash;She is drest in a
neat shell Callico Gown, has very light Hair done up with a Feather,
&amp; her whole carriage is easy inoffensive, &amp; graceful&mdash;The other Miss
Lee's are small Towards evening came in George Lee, &amp; Mr <i>Grubb</i>,
an English Gentleman; the Company danced after candle-light a
Minuet round, three Country Dances, several Reels, when we were
Rung to Supper after Supper we sit til twelve drinking loyal
Toasts&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 25.</i></p>

<p>Ben &amp; I slept til eight&mdash;we breakfasted at nine, soon after Christien
collected his School and gave them a Lesson round&mdash;About ten the
two Gentlemen left us. They quit Dancing about two&mdash;After Dinner
Mrs <i>Carter</i> &amp; the young Ladies, with Mr <i>Christien</i> Ben &amp; Myself
walked in the garden, &amp; through the Pasture, There are several
beautiful prospects of the green Bottoms, &amp; of the River Nominy
from the High hills&mdash;By Miss Washington I wrote a letter to Mr
Lowe, acquainting him with what was done for him in the business
he sent by me to Philadelphia. The Day is cool, &amp; intirely agreeable
&amp; the Ground has been refreshed by a Shower or two lately&mdash;I am
told that the people are already reaping not only Rye but Wheat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>

up myself therefore in my chamber to reading&mdash;Eleven I am sent for
to see Mr Lowe who is come&mdash;I invite him to my Room, where we
sit til Dinner&mdash;He informed me of the Manner of Trials in Scotland,
which Candidates undergo. It is similar &amp; indeed almost the same as
with our Presbytery Evening Mr Carter returned about seven
o-Clock from Williamsburg; He has been unwell himself while
there, &amp; he informs us that many are indisposed in that City While
we were at Coffee I was taken with a Sudden &amp; unusual pain in my
Breast, a sickness at my stomach, attended with a trembling and
dizzy faintness; I retired to my Room immediately, laid myself down
in bed but had a Fever most of the Night&mdash;</p>

shew'd me a book of vocal Musick which he has just imported, it is

but reads carelessly thick &amp; inaccurately.</p>

<p>&mdash;I mentioned to Day Mr <i>Peck</i> to Mr <i>Carter</i> He objected at first to
his Age as rather too young for the Duty of a Tutor, he assented
however &amp; requested me to write him word that he is desired to come
by the Time I shall leave Virginia&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday July 1. 1774.</i></p>

<p>I rose at six. The morning bearable Breakfasted with us 'Squire Lee.&mdash;About
one came in Captain <i>Blackwell</i>, Mr <i>Grubb</i>, &amp; <i>Lancelot Lee</i>.
the two youngsters came suddenly into our Room, bold gay &amp; noisy.
We conversed with them till the Bell rung for Dinner, when we all
repair'd to the dining-Room: Captain Blackwel is to sail in about
ten Days for London. I gave the Children the afternoon for Recreation.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 2.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Grubb</i> called again about twelve with an intention to ride out to
the Potowmack but there came on a Rain &amp; kept us at Home&mdash;We
spent the afternoon sociably in our Room. Miss <i>Nancy Carter</i> last
Night or this morning, in some whimsical freak, clipt off her Eye-Brows;
She has a very good Skin; exceeding black hair, &amp; black-well
arched, full Eye-brows, which, as I said the other day are much
esteemed in Virginia&mdash;She denies positively that She cut them herself,
&amp; swears some mischievous person has done it when She was
sleeping. But I am inclined to think it is an experiment She has been
making on herself to see how she can vary the looks of her face. It
made me laugh when I saw it first, to think how early &amp; how truely
She copies Female absurdities.</p>

<p>Towards evening we rode out merely for exercise, &amp; straggled at
last to Mr <i>Simpsons</i>; near his house we saw two trees standing near
each other both of which have lately been struck by Lightning &amp;
are torn to shivers in several parts&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr Grubb agreed to stay the night. we supt on Artichoks, &amp;
Huckleberries &amp; Milk&mdash;The toasts, after Supper, were the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Queen &amp; Royal Family, the Governor &amp; his family, &amp; then young
Ladies of our acquaintance&mdash;We were alone. Mr and Mrs Carter
left us immediately, so that we spent the evening without restraint.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 3.</i></p>

<p>We were all to go to Church to day, but we were prevented by a
storm of thunder &amp; Rain; the Ground is now sufficiently wetted&mdash;I
have not heard a Sermon on Sunday since the fifteenth of May; a
longer Vacancy from publick worship than I have ever had since
my first remembrance. About ten an old Negro Man came with a
complaint to Mr Carter of the Overseer that he does not allow him
his Peck of corn a Week&mdash;The humble posture in which the old
Fellow placed himself before he began moved me. We were sitting
in the passage, he sat himself down on the Floor clasp'd his Hands
together, with his face directly to Mr <i>Carter</i>, &amp; then began his Narration&mdash;He
seem'd healthy, but very old, he was well dress'd but
complained bitterly&mdash;I cannot like this thing of allowing them no
meat, &amp; only a Peck of Corn &amp; a Pint of Salt a Week, &amp; yet requiring
of them hard &amp; constant Service. We have several Rains this day
so that the Ground is sufficiently wetted&mdash;I spent the greater part of
the day writing at my Sermon.</p>


<p><i>Monday 4.</i></p>

<p>I begun to read the first Volume of Tristam-Shandy&mdash;He is droll in
the account he gives us of his Birth &amp; Family&mdash;We have several good
showers to day, the weather is warm, funky, very damp, &amp; I fear
will not turn out long to be healthful. With us in Jersey wet Weather
about this time not only is prejudicial to the Harvest, but is generally
thought, &amp; I believe almost never fails being a forerunner of Agues,
Fall-Fevers, Fluxes, &amp; our Horse-Distempers&mdash;Fearing these, any of
which so far from Home, would be painful &amp; expensive, I keep myself
much at Home, contrary to the repeated &amp; strong invitations of
the youngsters&mdash;And indeed my Duty, seems to require my Presence
pretty constantly; &amp; I am forced to produce an Example for
what I find it necessary to enforce on our Boys, in order to do it
with some face, for they always call upon me for a Reason for every
one of my precepts&mdash;It is now the Height of Harvest&mdash;There is at
Mr Turburville's a young Lady, from the Isle-of Wight, Miss <i>Betsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Lee</i>,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> a Sister of <i>George</i> &amp; <i>Lancelot Lee's</i>&mdash;It is proposed that Ben
&amp; I go this Evening to the Captain's &amp; Invite her here&mdash;Accordingly
after School we rode on our errand, We found besides Miss <i>Lee</i>&mdash;Mr
<i>George Turburville</i>, his <i>Wife</i>, Mr <i>Grubb</i>, &amp; <i>Lancelot Lee</i>&mdash;After
the ceremony of Introduction, &amp; our Congees were over, we took
our seats in a cool passage where the Company were sitting; all the
Company when we entered were laughing at Master <i>Lee</i>, who had
been gathering Mulberries, &amp; either through <i>carelessness</i> or <i>Greediness</i>
had stained his ruffles&mdash;At any Rate they looked like a scarlet
Clock in a Bunters stocking, both indilicate &amp; impudent&mdash;The attention
of the Company however being wholly taken up with Mr
Lee, I had the opportunity, which I wanted, of examining the person
of his Sister, without being interrupted either by the notice of others,
or by my own timidity&mdash;Miss <i>Betsy Lee</i>, I am told is but lately entered
her twenty sixth year; She is a well set maid, of a proper
Height, neither high nor low&mdash;Her Aspect when she is sitting is
masculine &amp; dauntless; she sits very erect; places her feet with great
propriety, her Hands She lays carelessly in her lap, &amp; never moves
them but when she has occasion to adjust some article of her dress, or
to perform some exercise of the <i>Fan</i>&mdash;She has a full face, sanguine
Complection, her Nose is rather protuberant than otherwise; Her
Eyes are exactly such as <i>Homer</i> atributes to the Goddess <i>Minerva</i>;
&amp; her Arms resemble those which the same Poet allows to <i>Juno</i>.
When She has a Bonnet on &amp; Walks, She is truely elegant; her carriage
neat &amp; graceful, &amp; her presence soft &amp; beautiful&mdash;Her hair is a
dark Brown, which was crap'd up very high. &amp; in it she had a Ribbon
interwoven with an artificial Flower&mdash;At each of her ears dangled a
brilliant Jewel; She was pinched up rather too near in a long pair of
new fashioned Stays, which, I think, are a Nusance both to us &amp;
themselves&mdash;For the late importation of Stays which are said to be
now most fashionable in London, are produced upwards so high that
we can have scarce any view at all of the Ladies Snowy Bosoms; &amp;
on the contrary, they are extended downwards so low that whenever
Ladies who wear them, either young or old, have occasion to
walk, the motion necessary for Walking, must, I think, cause a disagreeable
Friction of some part of the body against the lower Edge of
the Stays which is hard &amp; unyielding&mdash;I imputed the Flush which
was visible in her Face to her being swathed up <i>Body</i> &amp; <i>Soul</i> &amp; <i>limbs</i>
together&mdash;She wore a light Chintz Gown, very fine, with a blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
stamp; elegantly made, &amp; which set well upon her&mdash;She wore a blue
silk Quilt&mdash;In one word Her Dress was rich &amp; fashionable&mdash;Her Behaviour
such as I should expect to find in a Lady whose education
had been conducted with some care &amp; skill; and her person, abstracted
from the embelishments of Dress &amp; good Breeding, not much handsomer
than the generality of Women&mdash;</p>

<p>What made me desirous to see, &amp; curious to reconnoitre this young
Lady, was, a Sentence that was dropt yesterday by a respectable
Member of our Family, intimating a Desire that I may, on seeing
Miss Lee, after having known, by report, her faultless character, be so
pleased with her person as to try to make her mine, &amp; settle in this
Province&mdash;That kind Body, who is for making me happy by settling
me in Virginia, &amp; connecting me with one of the best families in the
Government, little knows how painful it would be if I was indeed
compell'd by any accident of Fortune to spend the remainder of my
Days in Virginia if is the pleasure of Providence that I am to continue
for any length of time in the World&mdash;Strong, &amp; sweet are the
bands which tye us to our place of nativity; If it is but a beggarly
Cottage, we seem not satisfied with the most elegant entertainment
if we are totally seperated from it&mdash;But if a Princess should solicit
me to accept, together with Herself, 50000 a Year&mdash;I declare, with
as great <i>pleasure</i> as <i>truth</i>, that the esteem, &amp; Fidelity which I possess
for my dear, dear <i>Eliza</i> would make me without reflection, evade
&amp; refuse the Proposal&mdash;Ben &amp; I returned Home before dark&mdash;We
had the 'Squire to drink Coffee with us&mdash;He brought us a Newspaper
containing the debate, of the House of Commons concerning the Repeal
of the Tea-duty.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 5.</i></p>

<p>While we were at Breakfast came from Hobbes-Holes Mrs <i>Oakly</i> a
Woman who has acted as nurse for several of Mrs Carters Children
with great credit&mdash;All the family speak of her with Love &amp; regard&mdash;This
day is very warm, but no rain&mdash;I gave all the Girls this day to
chat with their old acquaintance&mdash;Tho' the weather is warm &amp; very
Damp we have here no Musquetoes; I have not seen one, since I came
into the Province as I can now recollect which seems to me a little
strange; for at Princeton in Jersey some warm evenings in July &amp;
August they are so numerous as to be troublesome, &amp; that is more
than twenty miles from Salt Water, this not more than three times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as many <i>Rod</i>.&mdash;In the evening, among several other things Mr Carter
informed me that he has on this plantation a Negro Man called Prince
who is now unwell of a Strain&mdash;This Man, he swears, he would not
sell for 500 ready Cash&mdash;I was almost ready to say it is more
Money than I would give for all he owns on his Estate&mdash;The evening
is very pleasant I had an oppertunity on the Pavement before
the Hall Door of shewing away on Astronomy to Mrs <i>Carter</i>, I
lectured for half an hour on the Milky-Way, on several of the Stars,
on Jupiter in particular, &amp; on the Course of Comets&mdash;</p>

<p>In bed by half after ten as usual.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 6.</i></p>

<p>Ben seems pretty well recovered&mdash;We dined to day on the Fish
call'd the Sheeps-Head, with Crabs&mdash;Twice every Week we have
fine Fish, &amp; every Day good Fruit for Dinner, caudled Apples, Hurtle-Berries
with milk &amp;c&mdash;Yes, says Mrs Carter at Supper, this hot
weather takes away all my life; the small Lightning that we now have
makes me uneasy &amp; melancholy&mdash;I love to see her in such Distress&mdash;<i>Beauty</i>
&amp; <i>Virtue</i> when combined together &amp; Strugling against Misfortune;
O how such objects move, &amp; awaken the most delicate sensations
of our Souls&mdash;Call in Nancy to her Guitar, says the Colonel.
In She minces slow &amp; silent from her supper&mdash;She scratches her Instrument,
after a long preparation, into the Air of "Water parted
from the Sea." What, pray Miss Nancy, what bewitched you with a
desire of clipping your Eye-Brows&mdash;The Genius of Woman shines
forth in this little Girlish trick&mdash;Pray Mr <i>Fithian</i>, was you ever
taught Singing? Yes Sir, I attended two years&mdash;Had you any instructions
in particular for using the Shake<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>&mdash;I am giving Nancy some
Lessons, but She is vastly indolent&mdash;Nancy, play over and sing the
Funeral Hymn&mdash;Excuse me, Papa, I have lost the Verses&mdash;Happy
Soul, thy Days are ended,&mdash;Go on&mdash;How steady &amp; how sharp it
lightens in the North too&mdash;Good Night.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 7.</i></p>

<p>Yes Fanny may sit down to Breakfast&mdash;Where's Ben&mdash;The Weather
is hot &amp; Ben for enjoyment had stript himself naked&mdash;Of every thing
but his shirt &amp; Trowsers&mdash;Where's Ben&mdash;He is not very well, Madam,&mdash;This
Day says the Colonel after having Prefac'd our Breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with a&mdash;"God bless us in what we are to recieve"&mdash;is our Rye
yonder to be mown down; mown down thinks I, do they mow their
Grain in Virginia&mdash;Yes two Negroes take naked Sythes &amp; mow
down the Grain; others are imploy'd in raking it into heaps, but
much of it is left&mdash;Shall I help you, Mr Fithian, to a Dish of Coffee?&mdash;I
choose a deep Plate, if you please, Ma'am, &amp; Milk&mdash;Our Corn,
Madam, in Jersey is inferior to yours in this Province&mdash;Or your
Cooks, Sir, are less Skilful in managing it&mdash;Well, Nancy, I have tuned
your Guitar; you are to practice to Day with Priscilla, who is to
play the Harpsichord, till twelve o Clock; You can repeat the Verses
of the Funeral Hymn?&mdash;I can Sir&mdash;What, Harry, do you hesitate at
that plain Sum in Arithmetical Progression?&mdash;<i>Bob</i>, attend to your
Business&mdash;When I am bedizen'd with these clamorous children, sometimes
I silently exclaim&mdash;Once I was told, now I know I feel how
irksome the Pedagoging Scheme is&mdash;Fanny&mdash;I say, Fanny, dont you
hear me, Fanny, and Betsy, sit down&mdash;pray, Sir, must I multiply
here by 32&mdash;Yes, thick-Scull&mdash;But Mr Fithian, I dont know how to
divide by 5&frac12;&mdash;Look, Sir, do you see what Mouth's <i>Harry Willis</i> is
making?&mdash;I can say my Lesson&mdash;Buz, Buz&mdash;To divide by 5&frac12; you
must double both your Dividend &amp; divi[sor]&mdash;Half after two we were
rung to Dinner; poor <i>Tasker</i>, his Fever has continued high since
yesterday afternoon, he lies quiet, and asks for nothing&mdash;If his Disorder
does not abate to night, I shall give him in the morning a dose
of "James's Powder"&mdash;Will you lend me Jack, he meant my Horse,
says Mr Randolph, to ride tomorrow to Captain Cheltons; Yes Mr
Randolph, I will oblige Jenny so far.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 8.</i></p>

<p>I swear, says Bob, Harry belies me. I never told the Nurse that
Harriot should stay in School all Day&mdash;It was Mama's order that so
long as Mrs <i>Oakly</i> the Nurse stays, Harriot is to go into School after
Breakfast, &amp; after Dinner, &amp; say a lesson each time&mdash;I was passing
through the Hall from Breakfast&mdash;The Nurse, a short Stump of a
[wom]an, who blundered by mere accident, when she was young,
out of the road in which Virgins commonly travel, &amp; felt the difficulties
of being a Mother, several years before She enjoyed the
Pleasures of being a Wife&mdash;She call'd to me, &amp; begg'd me to close
the Quarrel; You shall have, said I, dear Madam, with the greatest
Freedom my consent&mdash;Harriot shall be with you&mdash;At Breakfast&mdash;Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is Ben?&mdash;He breakfasts with the House-keeper Madam&mdash;At
School&mdash;What a likeness there is in the manners of Boys; Bob, &amp;
Harry had skulk'd behind the writing-Table with their Slates on
their Knees, &amp; their Faces close together, just as I have done a thousand
Times, in our little School-House in <i>Greenwich</i>&mdash;But once I
was threshed confoundedly for a piece of such hidden play&mdash;<i>Tom
Parks</i> [blotted] asleep, poor Fellow he is now sleeping in the Dust;&mdash;Then
he was fast asleep on a Bench, with his mouth open&mdash;I fill'd
his mouth with Snuff!&mdash;He sprung up&mdash;Nature was in distress, &amp;
found all her Avenues too scanty at that time to clear out at once
the tickling penetrating Powder&mdash;He snuffed&mdash;He coughed&mdash;He&mdash;He
told the Master, &amp; then I was tickled&mdash;Indeed he made my Feet
beat time to his Lash&mdash;-Says Bob to Harry, behind the Table, I wonder
Mr <i>Fithian</i> has not fallen in Love yet with some of our Nominy-Girls&mdash;Here
he sits from Month to Month&mdash;(Not many Months
longer said I to myself)&mdash;Mr <i>Marshal</i><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> was always out; I suppose
Mr <i>Fithian</i> never thinks of Girls&mdash;Indeed says <i>Harry</i>, drawing his
chair clos[e &amp;] lowering his voice, I never in my Life saw a Man
who thought so little of these things&mdash;Here Tom the Coachman
came in with a wood Tarripin which he brought to be a resident in
our Room to catch the Bugs &amp; Cockroaches&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, Harry, &amp; Bob, <i>Fithian</i> is vulnerable by Cupids Arrows&mdash;I assure
you, Boys, he is, Not by the Girls of Westmorland&mdash;O my dear
Laura, I would not injure your friendly Spirit; So long as I breathe
Heavens vital air I am unconditionally &amp; wholly Yours&mdash;At Dinner,
Mrs Carter call'd for the Chariot, Mrs Turburville will think me
rude, unless I welcome her Home. I will take Priscilla this Afternoon
&amp; make her a visit&mdash;I saw in a moment that <i>Miss</i> was better pleased
with the notion of trotting off in the Carriage, than to be [blotted]
up with Multiplication &amp; Division&mdash;O yes, says Mrs <i>Oakly</i>, I know
Dadda <i>Gumby</i> at <i>Williamsburg</i>. I think you look as brisk, as hearty
&amp; as young now as you did ten years ago&mdash;<i>Gumby</i>&mdash;I &amp; my old
Woman, here Master, are the two oldest Negres in Mr <i>Carters</i> Estate.
Here we live, Master, on our worthy Landlords Bounty&mdash;The <i>Nurse</i>,
<i>Betsy</i>, &amp; <i>Harriot</i> were at Gumby's House which stands about twenty
Rod from the Garden&mdash;I was walking, with a Book in my Fist,
musing &amp; stumbling along&mdash;I saw them, I went up, &amp; with a lower
Bow than I should give to a Nurse, if Women were plenty, says I,
pray Mrs <i>Oakly</i> do you know Dadda Gumby? We stood chattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
with the old African, or rather he stood chattering with us, relating
one story after another, leaving some of his Narrations half untold,
beginning others in the middle having entered into the true Spirit
of Loquacity&mdash;Dennis, in the Height of a Story about his Grandfathers
Uncle's harpooning a <i>Porpoise</i> summoned me to Coffee&mdash;Mrs
Oakly, will you walk?&mdash;Come Betsy&mdash;Where's Ben?&mdash;Says the
Colonel has Ben r[e]tired from the World?&mdash;He rode out this Evening,
Sir, about five o Clock for Exercise&mdash;Mrs Carter, Mr Carter,
good Night&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 9.</i></p>

<p>I was waked by <i>Sam</i> the Barber thumping at my Door&mdash;I was
dressed&mdash;In Powder too; for I propose to see &amp; dine with Miss <i>Jenny
Washington</i> to Day. D&mdash;n the Bugs &amp; Chinches, says <i>Ben</i> rolling
over on the Bed, &amp; rubbing his Eyes, I have slept none for them&mdash;Mr
Fithian, do you rest any o-Nights? Dont these cursed Bugs keep
you awake?&mdash;No Sir; for you see I commonly sit &amp; read til half after
ten, or eleven&mdash;So that by the Time I lay my poor Skin &amp; Bones on
the Bed, I am so much fatigued with the tumultuous Business of the
Day, &amp; the Study of the Evening that my sleep the rest of the night
is sound &amp; unbroken&mdash;Priscilla hangs her head a little this morning,
She looks feverish, dispirited, sits on a low bench, with her Elbow in
her Lap, &amp; Leaning her head upon her hand, swings backwards and
forwards, just as I have seen beautiful Quaker Girls when they are
weeping at the frightful distortions &amp; Grimaces of some deep-inspired
<i>Father</i>. But <i>Priscilla</i> &amp; <i>Tasker</i> are unwell&mdash;Fanny teizes me for a
Picture, I must draw her a slip, she says, on Paper like the one I drew
for Her the other Day with my finger in the Sand&mdash;I love the little
careless Girl, &amp; will oblige her&mdash;On the writing-Table in the School-Room
I found this morning an old Book of Esops Fables done into
English Verse; In the Margins of this Book up &amp; Down Bob had in
his scribbling Way recorded the Names of several young Ladies of
Westmorland &amp; Richmond Counties. I shall set them down, as I
turned over the Leaves &amp; found them&mdash;I do not insinuate, by writing
this Story, the smallest reproach to either of the Ladies; I mention it
solely to shew <i>Bob's</i> Taste, &amp; the Meditations of his heart when
wholly alone. In the Life of Esop, page 23, at the Bottom of the Leaf
his own Name is written at full length &amp; in as elegant a hand as he is
master of with a Dash below.</p>

<p>He has in the same manner introduced it a few leaves further on, he
has done this to be a kind of Preface for what is to follow; he has
also very cleverly interspersed it with the Ladies, either that the
Ladies Names should be a foil to set his off to advantage, or that his
Name be a Foil to adorn the Ladies&mdash;In the Life of Woglog the

<p>Indeed says Mrs Carter at Breakfast a Fire this morning would be
very pleasant&mdash;Yes says I, for I have had the look &amp; feeling of
November all the morning; My Room shut up, My Coat buttoned,
&amp; yet my Body cold Besides!&mdash;Mr Carter on this, advanced a strange
Assertion, that there is not a single Person on this whole Continent, if
this Change is as powerful through the Continent as it is here, who is
not to day, in a greater or less Degree affected with a Fever!&mdash;My
poor skinny Body, I know is in a prodigious Tumult; I impute it tho
to my ride Yesterday to Church in the schorching Sun; &amp; to drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
five or six Glasses of Wine extraordinary&mdash;<i>Priscilla</i> &amp; <i>Harriot</i> are
confined at Home of an eruptive Fever, some think it a Swine Pox
at any Rate they are sick, &amp; break out into Pustules&mdash;I am in such
Ferment to Day that I cannot sit nor Walk, nor Write with any
Stomach&mdash;I made out tho' with some Difficulty to finish a rough
Draught of my Sermon, &amp; laid by for future Perusal.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 12.</i></p>

<p>Indeed I enjoy this fine cool weather, says Ben as he lay on his Back
in the Bed rubbing his Eyes, &amp; ears about half after six o-Clock;
<i>Lancelot Lee</i> had never I am sure, more sensible Pleasure in swallowing
a well prepar'd Dinner&mdash;To be sure I have slept last Night with
the sweetest composure in Spight of the Chinches, &amp; in spight of my
Disorder!&mdash;Get up, Lump of Indolence, said I to him; Get up &amp; clap
to <i>Virgil</i> instead of lying there &amp; boasting&mdash;Breakfasted with us
Captain Guthrie, of a Small Schooner of <i>Norfolk</i>; &amp; Mr Stadley the
Musician&mdash;I love this good German, He used to teach in <i>New York</i>
&amp; <i>Philadelphia</i>&mdash;He has much simplicity &amp; goodness of heart&mdash;He
performs extremely well&mdash;He is kind &amp; sociable with me&mdash;Dined
with us one&mdash;one&mdash;Mr&mdash;Mr&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;I know his trade
tho': An Inspector&mdash;He is rather Dull, &amp; seems unacquainted with
company for when he would, at Table, drink our Health, he held the
Glass of Porter fast with both his Hands, and then gave an insignificant
nod to each one at the Table, in Hast, &amp; with fear, &amp; then drank
like an Ox&mdash;The Good Inspector, at the second toast, after having
seen a little our Manner "Gentlemen &amp; Ladies (but there was none
in Womans Cloathing at Table except Mrs Carter) The King"&mdash;I
thought that during the Course of the Toasts, he was better pleased
with the Liquor than with the manner in which he was at this Time
obliged to use it&mdash;I made a b[e]gining of my Latin Thesis&mdash;"Cuinam
Usui inservi: at Lex moralis sub Evangeliis." I made out to write thus
much&mdash;Duabus hisce Propositionibus sequentibus simulatim Respondeo.&mdash;But
if I wrote so much every Day for a twelve Month my
Thesis will be short. The Day is pleasant, cool enough: &amp; my disorder
which has been for several days a growing painful <i>Dysentery</i>,
seems to have subsided&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Laura</span>.</p>

<p>The Summer is advancing briskly on, &amp; bringing me with it every
Day still nearer to you&mdash;And to my last Change&mdash;With you I am
looking for the purest Happiness in Friendship &amp; Love that I can
derive from any thing below; And it will add to measure of Felicity
if I can make the Woman I choose to protect &amp; esteem think me
worthy her Regard.</p>

<p>I said that the swift Advances of Summer are bringing me swiftly on
to Death&mdash;In Virginia there are numberless Admonitions to this
Reflection, but I suppress any farther Declaration. I wrote you by
Mr &mdash;&mdash; early last Month; &amp; at the same Time I wrote to several
of my Acquaintances: but if they lived in the Moon I could hear
from them as often as I do now when only a Couple of Hundred
Miles, or a little more, separates us: Would it not be more agreeable
to me if they did&mdash;? For then I should every Night almost, see, at
least, the Place of their Habitation, tho' we could have no Correspondence.</p>

<p>You are such a Pilgrim, Laura; I mean such a Rover, that I am at
some Loss to know how to direct a Letter to you; &amp; I want my Letters,
while they are on their Passage to go through as few Hands as
possible, not because I write any <i>Secrecy</i>, or <i>Scandal</i>, for you will
not allow either the one or the other; but only that you may speedily
receive &amp; read the Little I do write, fresh from my Heart.</p>

<p>I suppose that Miss &mdash;&mdash; has before now seen Cohansie&mdash;And
cloyed of it too, no Doubt. She is a lively, sportful Soul. But that
dear Place, which ingrosses so many of my Thoughts, has not
Variety enough to entertain her long&mdash;You yourself, who are not
always soaring on Follie's Wing, through the Regions of Vanity &amp;
Nonsense, sometimes find the Country dull&mdash;But Miss &mdash;&mdash; does not
find Satisfaction in the City; it is plain then since that young Lady
cannot find Contentment either in City or Country, that She cannot
be happy at all.</p>

<p>Merciful, merciful Heaven! O grant me what I am trying hard to
obtain; grant that my Inclinations be all duely bended to a perfect
Satisfaction with my Lot here&mdash;! With such a Temper I shall be at
Rest, be happy, if I continue here in Virginia; Or I shall be happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
if I remove into new Jersey; But, must I declare it, Laura, that if I
am destitute of this, I should be wretched, tho' your Friend &amp; Companion&mdash;I
am,</p>

<p>I drew off this morning for Dadda <i>Gumby</i> a List of his Children, &amp;
their respective ages&mdash;He himself is 94&mdash;For this office I had as many
<i>Thanks</i>, As I have had <i>blessings</i> before now from a Beggar for Sixpence&mdash;Thank
you, thank you, thank you Master, was the language
of the old Greyheaded pair.&mdash;Call on us at any time, you shall have

them in my Turn for their Offers, &amp; left them&mdash;</p>

<p>Indeed, said the Colonel at Breakfast, cool as it was last Night, I
kept my Window up the whole night&mdash;I am not fond of your hot a

without panting I am for keeping my Window down, &amp; my Room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
close on summer nights; especially here in Virginia, Madam, where
the Dews are so heavy, and so dangerous&mdash;The Postilion keeps a fox
at the Stable &amp; I am often much diverted with his Cunning Tricks.
The other Day, Mrs Carter was lying in the long room among the
Books on the Couch; In jumps Reynard, through a broken Pane of
Glass, &amp; begins to frisk &amp; hue about the Room like a Bedlam&mdash;How
is Nurse, pray, says the Colonel at Dinner? She has her Ague &amp; Fever
again to Day, Sir&mdash;This is a fine Sheeps-Head, Mr Stadly shall I help
you?&mdash;Or would you prefer a <i>Bass</i> or a <i>Perch</i>?&mdash;Or perhaps you
will rather help yourself to some picked <i>Crab</i>&mdash;It is all extremely
fine, Sir, I'll help myself&mdash;Well says the Colonel when we had almost
finished our Dinner with a Glass of sparkling Porter on the Table
before him, we have but fasted to Day; here stands a fine Ham, &amp; a
Shoulder of excellent Mutton yet untouched&mdash;At least, says the
merry, good-hearted Man, we have kept <i>Lent</i>&mdash;Yesterday evening I
scribled a little for <i>Laura</i>, &amp; to Day I drank her Health from my
Heart in generous Medaira&mdash;Yes, best of Women, when you are the
Toast I drink wine with Pleasure&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 14.</i></p>

<p>To Day is the election of Burgesses in Richmond the neighbouring
County&mdash;Come, Fithian, will you go? My old objection recurs; I am
too busy&mdash;I met this morning in Wingates Arithmetic, with the following
merry Problem&mdash;"To discover a Number which any one
shall have in his mind, without requiring him to reveal any part of
that or any Number whatsoever"&mdash;After any one has thought upon
any number at Pleasure; bid him double it, &amp; to that double bid him
add any such even number as you please to assign: Then from the
Sum of that Addition let him reject one half, &amp; reserve the other half;
Lastly, from this half bid him subtract the Number which he first
thought upon; then you may boldly tell him what Number remains
in his mind after that Subtraction is made, for it will be always half
the Number which you assigned him to add&mdash;A Reason for the Rule
is added. "Because, if to the double of any number (which number
for Distinction sake I call the first) a second number be added, the
half of the Sum must necessarily consist of the said first number, &amp;
half the Second: Therefore if from the said half sum the first Number
be subtracted, the remainder must of necessity be half the second
Number which was added&mdash;Mr Inspector dined with us again to day&mdash;We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>

a Bowl of <i>Grogg</i>&mdash;You are a mean Puppy, a treacherous, ungenerous
Scoundrel, says <i>Bob</i>, to Harry just as I entered the School after Dinner&mdash;you
told Mr <i>Lowe</i>, you did more, you published in Mr Washingtons
Family that Mr <i>Fithian</i> horsed me for Staying out all night&mdash;That
he call'd in John the Waiter to help him&mdash;&amp; that you was sent
to cut &amp; bring in Whips&mdash;After School with Ben I rode out the Day
is warm, &amp; the Ground grows to be very dry&mdash;I was not a little
Surprized to see Corn out in Tassel&mdash;But the Tobacco looks dismal,
it is all poor, much of it is dead with the drouth; I think, however,
that the Season is ten days or two Weeks earlier here than in New
Jersey.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fryday 15.</i></p>

<p>I got up a little before six &amp; as it is very warm, I threw up the window
to enjoy the Morning's fine salubrious Air&mdash;I saw a <i>Lady</i>&mdash;She was
walking to the <i>Poplars</i>&mdash;She appeared small but walked genteel&mdash;She
walked slow &amp; looked on the ground&mdash;Her Dress look'd to be
extremely good, but was only thrown carelessly on; She had a Silk
shade thrown over her shoulders in which her hands were muffled&mdash;I
had the Idea in a moment of a Woman in some kind of Difficulty&mdash;But
how can such a woman have been to Mr Carters &amp; done Business,
who was not there last night.?&mdash;It was Mrs <i>Oakly</i>&mdash;She has the
Ague and was walking for the benefit of the <i>Morning Air</i>.&mdash;We are
rid of two <i>troubles</i> from this morning till Monday: for <i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Nancy</i>

great troubles, indeed, for this hot weather I can hardly keep
them in the Room, much less to any useful business&mdash;Please to excuse
me from Dinner, says Mrs Carter, &amp; retired to her Chamber&mdash;There
appears in the North a black Cloud, where it Thunders&mdash;Send
us a Shower in Mercy, bountiful Heaven, tho' our Sins deserve

there comes a kind Shower&mdash;After the Rain about six Ben &amp; I took
a Ride for exercise, the Corn litterally looks glad&mdash;I have made a

<p>I have communicated your intention to Mr <i>Carter</i>; he begs you
will by no Means disappoint him.</p>

<p>I wrote you a letter by the post early in June possibly it was lost,
for either letters are lost, or you and the rest of my friends in <i>Jersey</i>
use me vastly ill, for I have not received a line since I have been in
Virginia&mdash;You had better go into the school and acquaint yourself
with the method of teaching, and procure some copper plate copies:
I am by the goodness of heaven very well; I hope you will remember
me to all friends at Princeton to relations and friends at Cohansie;
desire <i>Charles</i> to carry my <i>Homer</i> to cohansie when he goes down in
the vacancy; tell him I shall be at home if no unforeseen accident
prevents by the last of october.</p>

<p>You had better provide yourself with recommendations from
several, especially from Doctor Witherspoon, something of the kind
will not be a hindrance, but may possibly at some J[u]ncture be of
eminent Service.</p>

<p>The <i>Colonel</i>, <i>Ben</i>, &amp; <i>myself</i> rode on Horse-back about Six to Mr
Atwels; four lusty, hearty Men had gone on foot before who were
Oarsmen: Here we were to enter a Boat never Rowed before, &amp;
proceed down the River Machodock to Mr <i>Carters</i> Store-Houses
which are now building near the mouth of that River&mdash;But I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
going to venture upon a Description of a Scene which I am sure I
shall not do Justice to&mdash;A Scetch of three Rivers&mdash;Their Beautiful
Banks&mdash;Several Gentlemens Seats&mdash;Their commodious harbours&mdash;In
particular that near which Mr <i>Carter</i> is erecting Store-Houses&mdash;The
whole is to be an account of our peregrination this 16th burning day
of July 1774&mdash;With several remarks.&mdash;What a Crack of Thunder
there was! I must run to the Window &amp; view the Cloud&mdash;It is a small
white remote Cloud in the North-West. I am summoned to Coffee&mdash;Mrs
<i>Carter</i> gave us a Dish round&mdash;Amazing what a Flash of Lightning!
how fast it rises!&mdash;Ben child, says the lovely Woman, take my
Seat &amp; fill out the Coffee. Please to excuse me; &amp; She then retired up
chamber&mdash;We finished our Coffee&mdash;The Gust came up, &amp; to be sure
I have seldom seen one more terable! Long, bright, forked bolts
seemed to dart incessantly through the broken parts of the Cloud;
some of them would appear perpendicular others horizontal, and
some would split, &amp; in a Moment seem to bespangle, with sparks of
Fire, the whole Front of the Cloud! And these were continually succeeded
with alarming alternate Cracks of Thunder!&mdash;It brings, however
to the scorched Earth a plenteous needful Supply&mdash;By nine it is
past, &amp; opens a serene beautiful western Sky&mdash;I resume my Description.</p>

<p>I have said, that we rode on Horseback to Mr <i>Atwels</i> where we were
to go on board &amp; have our Horses sent back. This House is called six
Miles from the mouth of Machodock&mdash;It stands on the Bank of the
River; The Boat that carried us is built for the purpose of carrying
the young Ladies and others of the Family to Nominy Church&mdash;It is
a light neat <i>Battoe</i> elegantly painted &amp; is rowed with four Oars&mdash;We
went on board; The Sun beamed down upon us, but we had each an
Umberella&mdash;The River is here about Gunshot over; the Banks are
pretty low, but hard to the very Water&mdash;I was delighted to see Corn
&amp; Tobacco growing, or Cattle &amp; Sheep feeding along the Brink of
this River on both Sides, or else Groves of Pines, Savins &amp; Oaks growing
to the side of the Bank&mdash;We passed by an elegant small Seat of
Mr <i>Beal</i>;<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> it was small, but it was neat&mdash;We arrived at Mr <i>Carters
Store-Houses</i> in 50 minutes, they are 5 Miles from Mr <i>Atwels</i>, &amp;
one from Potowmack&mdash;These Houses are building for the reception
of Iron, Bread, Flour &amp;c. there are two Houses each 46 Feet long by
20.&mdash;They stand at the Bottom of a Bay which is a safe &amp; spacious
harbour&mdash;Here we Breakfasted at ten.&mdash;At twelve we pushed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
from thence &amp; rowed by parson Smiths Glebe &amp; in sight of his house
in to the broad beautiful Potowmack&mdash;: I think it is here ten Miles or
twelve over has a fine high hard Bank; no Marshes&mdash;but Cornfields,
Trees, or Grass!&mdash;Up the lovely Water we were rowed six Miles in
to the Mouth of Nominy&mdash;We went on Board a small Schooner
from <i>Norfolk</i> which lay in Nominy-Bay&mdash;Mr Carter is loading her
with Flour &amp; Iron&mdash;Here we were in Sight of Stratford, Colonel
Lee's, Seat.&mdash;We were in Sight too of Captain Cheltons&mdash;And of
Colonel Washingtons Seat at Bushfield&mdash;From the Schooner we
Rowed up Nominy-River&mdash;I have forgot to remark before that from
the time of our setting out as we were going down Machodock, &amp;
along the Potowmack-Shore, &amp; especially as we were rowing up
Nominy we saw Fishermen in great numbers in Canoes, &amp; almost
constantly taking in Fish Bass &amp; Perch&mdash;This was beautiful!&mdash;The
entrance of Nomini is very shoal, &amp; stony, the Channel is very narrow,
&amp; lies close to the Easternmost Side&mdash;On the edges of these shoals,
or in Holes between the Rocks is plenty of Fish&mdash;The Banks of
Nominy are steep and vastly high, twenty &amp; thirty Feet, &amp; in some
places almost perpendicular; The Course of the River is crooked,
&amp; the prospects on each Side vastly romantic &amp; diversified&mdash;We
arrived at the Granary near Nominy-Hall about six&mdash;I went to my
room to take off an Account of the expedition&mdash;When the Gust soon
hindred.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 17.</i></p>

<p>The Air this morning serene &amp; cool&mdash;I do not go to Church. At last
I have finished my Presbyterial pieces roughly they are to be reviewed
&amp; corrected; In the mean Time tho', (as Workman say) I
must blow a little, for to be sure I am fatigued&mdash;Mr <i>Fithian</i>, says
Mr <i>Carter</i> at Dinner with a serious Air, you see we cannot with conveniency
attend <i>Ucomico</i> Church. If I should propose having prayrs
read in the great Room on that vacant Day would you encourage &amp;
assist me?&mdash;I answered him that I was heartily agreed&mdash;You then,
Sir, says he, may read the <i>prayrs</i>&mdash;&amp; I will read the <i>Lessons</i>. The
Afternoon extremely hot I could not leave my Room til the Sun had
hid his flaming Place behind the Earth&mdash;Then I walked through the
Garden&mdash;The whole Family seem to be now out Black, White,
Male, Female, all enjoying the cool evening&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><i>Monday 18.</i></p>

<p>Pray Sir let all our Windows be put up, says Bob the Moment he
came down from his chamber, &amp; let the Doors be set open or we
shall faint with Heat&mdash;Such a night I never spent before&mdash;The Heat
says he, and these cursed Chinches made me intirely restless&mdash;I scribbled
over a Letter to Mr <i>John Peck</i>, &amp; one to Miss ... pray Mr
Fithian says Nancy draw me a picture such as you drew for Fanny
last Week&mdash;At two, just before we sit Down to Dinner a Cloud
appear'd in the West&mdash;Mrs Carter excused herself from Dinner;
while we were dining the Cloud came over, very moderate tho' with
plenty of Rain&mdash;It is now, says Mrs Carter at Coffee, cool enough, a
fine fair evening, a Northerly breeze &amp; lovely evening&mdash;Mrs Oakly
came into my Room this evening&mdash;It was to take her leave; she is to
leave us early tomorrow morning&mdash;Good night, said I to the little
Woman, I wish you a safe passage over the Rappahannock, &amp; a
pleasant journey home&mdash;I drew off as well as I could a rough plan
of Nominy-Hall for Nancy.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 19.</i></p>

<p>Nurse left us early this morning postilion Nat. carried her in a chair
to the Ferry&mdash;The Day is fine cool enough&mdash;After School in the
evening I rode out to a Corn-field, about a Mile &amp; a half off, where I
usually go for exercise, the Corn is beginning pretty generally to
tassel, &amp; I saw one hill in Silk, and in Blossom&mdash;To day I put <i>Harry</i>
into decimal Arithmetic&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 20.</i></p>

<p>Shut the Door, <i>Harriot</i>, says <i>Fanny</i> I I'm so cold I shake&mdash;indeed the
morning is cool enough to sit with December clothes on!&mdash;I spent
the little time I have for myself to Day in forming my Latin <i>Exegesis</i>&mdash;Mr
<i>Taylor</i> the head Overseer Dined with us&mdash;At <i>Coffee</i> The
Colonel &amp; myself entered somehow into Dispute upon the advantage
in working an Oar&mdash;He asserted &amp; tried to prove that the advantage
lies in having the Oar longer from the <i>Thole-pin</i> or where it lies on
the Boat to the water, than from the <i>Thole-pin</i> to the Rowers hand
in a mathematical sense; He allow'd the Water to be the Fulcrum or
Prop, &amp; the Boat to be the weight, &amp; the Rower to be a secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Power&mdash;But the resistance of the Water to the Oar he call'd the chief
&amp; primary Power&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 21.</i></p>

<p>Lazy Fellows! <i>Ben</i>, <i>Bob</i>, <i>Harry</i>, &amp; <i>Myself</i> all this Morning slept til
near seven!&mdash;It was a sleepy Morning tho', for the Girls to give us
countenance slept too&mdash;My Leisure time to Day is spent in forming
my Latin Exegesis&mdash;Only just before the Sun went Down <i>Ben</i> &amp; I
had our Horses &amp; rode to our accustomed Resort the Corn-field, now
many of the Hills are in Silk&mdash;We returned to Coffee&mdash;The Day has
been very warm; the evening is light &amp; pleasant, &amp;, Thank, to our
common, &amp; bountiful Preserver, I am in good Health&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 22.</i></p>

<p>My Exegesis goes on lustily; I have finished three pages&mdash;Indeed Sir,
says <i>Harry</i> I cannot reduce 7s 6d into the decimal of a Pound
Sterling&mdash;you must reduce 7s &amp; 6d to pence; for a numerator; then
you must reduce a Pound Sterling to Pence for a Denominator; this
Numerator you divide by the denominator &amp; the Quotient will be
the Decimal sought&mdash;Well <i>Ben</i> you &amp; Mr <i>Fithian</i> are invited by Mr
Turberville, to a Fish feast to-morrow, said Mr Carter when we
entered the Hall to Dinner&mdash;I am uncertain whether my Latinitas
will not be a Shackle too heavy to allow me to favour his kind invitation.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 23.</i></p>

<p><i>Priscilla</i>, &amp; <i>Fanny</i>, each presented me with a fine Jessamine Nosegay
this morning&mdash;At eight I dismissed the School: <i>Ben</i>, <i>Bob</i>, &amp;
<i>Harry</i> go to the <i>Fish-Feast</i>, I to making latin&mdash;While we were Dining
a black turbulent Cloud came over from the West (I believe the
Boys will commend my choice now) It rained, it Thundered hard,
&amp; continued exceeding stormy til after six in the Evening; I spent the
Afternoon however in Quiet &amp; to advantage&mdash;I am more &amp; more
pleased with my Situation. the Time draws nigh when I must enter
on a new, &amp; perhaps less agreable exercise&mdash;There were many at the
River; the Boys tell me, among others Miss <i>Betsy Lee</i>&mdash;I do not,
however, repent my having staid at Home&mdash;The Colonel shewed me
some Powder which was made in <i>Frederick</i> in this Province&mdash;It
seems good&mdash;He charged a <i>Pistol</i>, it fired quick &amp; strong&mdash;</p>

rode to Nomini-Church&mdash;The Parson invited me home but we
have company&mdash;Mr <i>Turberville</i>, <i>Mr Cunningham</i>, <i>George</i> &amp; <i>Lancelot
Lee</i> dined with us&mdash;After the ordinary Toasts we were call'd on
to Toast Ladies: I gave Miss <i>Jenny Washington</i>&mdash;The Lee's came
over to our School-Room I swear says George, there is no Devil!&mdash;There
is no Devil, I swear!&mdash;He went on in such an impious, &amp; at the
same time whimsical &amp; foolish manner, that I left the Room, and
went over to Mr &amp; Mrs Carter, with whom nothing is heard indecent
or profane&mdash;After the Company were gone as we were walking near
the Poplar Avenue, says Mrs Carter how sweet, &amp; pure the Air is;
how much the weather resembles September!&mdash;Indeed I think it
feels like the fever &amp; Ague!&mdash;<i>Bob</i> in the Evening brought me Colonel
Taylors<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> compliments, who begs I will wait on him soon; He wants
to know if I have provided a Tutor for Mrs <i>Thornton</i> Mr <i>Leek</i> told
me something about coming, but not til next Spring, &amp; I judge that
Mrs Thornton will be impatient before that time&mdash;Do you now indeed,
sincerely, in your Heart, Sir says Ben to me after we had retired
to our Chamber, believe that there is a Devil?&mdash;For my part, tho' I
made <i>George Lee</i> think otherwise, I do not&mdash;I told him that it was
universally allowed by writers of the greatest reputation for Learning
and Religion in the established Church of England, whose Canons
he profess'd to believe &amp; adhere to&mdash;And that, if he would attend to
my advice, he ought not to doubt its Reality.</p>


<p><i>Monday 25.</i></p>

<p><i>Harry</i> &amp; <i>Bob</i> go shrugging up their backs with their Coats Buttoned
about the School, first one then the other complaining of the cold&mdash;The
Girls too, in their white Frocks, huddle close together for the
benefit of warming each other, &amp; look like a Flock of Lambs in the
Spring&mdash;I wish they were half as innocent&mdash;I myself, after having
added a Waistcoat, am notwithstanding disagreeably Cold&mdash;The air
is clear, the wind strong from the West&mdash;I proceeded in my Latin
Exegesis, &amp; shall, I hope, shortly be through it&mdash;I gave to <i>Nancy</i> at
her Request, my Scetch of <i>Nominy-Hall</i>&mdash;I propose to take off one
for myself&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span><i>Teusday 26.</i></p>

<p>The morning cool enough&mdash;Order me a Horse &amp; Chair, says the
Colonel after Breakfast, for I must go to Westmoreland-Court&mdash;I
piddled at my Exegessis, but (as they say here in Virginia) I did a
mighty little&mdash;Priscilla after School invited me to ride with her, but
I had preengaged to go on Board the <i>Harriot</i>; She now lies in Nominy
about half a mile Distant&mdash;<i>Bob</i> conducted me on board, She is a neat
vessel, carries 1400 Bushels&mdash;<i>Bob</i> strip'd &amp; swam round us half an
hour&mdash;Coffee; Well, Sir, says the Colonel at las I can treat you with
several Letters&mdash;My heart jumped&mdash;A fine Repast indeed, valuable
because exceeding rare! But shall I hear any thing from&mdash;<i>Laura</i>?&mdash;On
this he gave me Letters from,</p>

<p>
1. Rev'd Enoch Green, Dated Feb: 1774.<br />
2. From Laura, Dated Feb: 13th 1774.<br />

6. From Andrew Hunter Junr: Dated June 24th. 1774. Cohansie.<br />
7. From Mr James Ewing, Dated Bridge-town July 7th. 1774.<br />
</p>

<p>For these Letters I paid&mdash;12s 5d&mdash;Pennsylvania Currency, &amp; I am
very proud of my Bargain&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr Peck informs me that he is to succeed me in this place&mdash;Mr
<i>Hunter</i> &amp; Mr Ewing inform me of the Death of Uncle Ephraim
Seeley! That he died of a <i>Diabetes</i> which has long troubled him! He
has left no Doubt a mourning Family&mdash;Mr <i>Hunter</i> writes me word
that <i>Andrew</i> was licensed to preach about the middle of June. Laura
says&mdash;They all express with Concern the great Commotions which
at present exist through the Colonies.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 27.</i></p>

<p>Somehow I have taken a bad Cold, &amp; am low-spirited to Day&mdash;The
Colonel was all the forenoon down at the <i>Harriot</i> in the Sun, so that
when we went in to dine he seem'd fatigued &amp; eat nothing&mdash;We have
an Addition to our numerous Family, one Mr &mdash;&mdash; I forget his
name, he is a Cooper, tho', &amp; an Irishman, &amp; seems to be pretty smart;
I sat the Evening with him in Mr Randolphs Room.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span><i>Thursday 28.</i></p>

<p>Evening, after the Sun had gone, with <i>Priss</i> I walked in the Garden.
we gathered some few Figs which are just growing ripe&mdash;My Leisure
to Day I spent in finishing off my Latin Exercises.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 29.</i></p>

<p>I feell wholly relieved of my cold&mdash;I wrote &amp; sent to the Post a Letter
to Mr <i>John Peck</i>, to remind &amp; hurry him in his way here&mdash;O! it
is very hot&mdash;The wind itself seems to be heated! We have a fine
Room, &amp; sufficiently open; &amp; I dress in a thin Waist-Coat, &amp; a loose,
light linen Gown; The <i>Boys</i>, <i>Harry</i> &amp; <i>Bob</i> have nothing on, in
School, but their shirts &amp; Breeches; and I laugh'd cordially to see the
contrivance of <i>Fanny</i>, the loveliest of them all, to grow cool, She
sat on a low bench, &amp; put her Hand in her pocket, &amp; seem'd exceeding
diligent in looking for something&mdash;But before She took out her hand
She had off both her Stockings, &amp; left them both in her pocket!&mdash;Mrs
<i>Carter</i> in particular seems to be overcome with the extreme Heat
&amp; looks like a fainting, expiring yet lovely Creature!&mdash;At seven I
rode out to the Corn-field, the Sun was almost down, &amp; was hid behind
a large white thick Cloud where it Thunders&mdash;The Corn is
roll'd up with the heat &amp; Drouth! Yet it is strange there is no
Musquetoes&mdash;I have seen one &amp; heard another, &amp; this is the whole
compliment I have either <i>seen</i>, <i>heard</i> or <i>felt</i> since I have been in
<i>Virginia</i>&mdash;While we were drinking <i>Coffee</i> the Lightning, as it began
to grow Dark, began to stream, it was at some Distance, but was
incessant, bright, &amp; awful&mdash;The Colonel, however sat, &amp; with unmoved
Composure observed it;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 30.</i></p>

<p>The weather is something cooler &amp; bearable this Morning&mdash;<i>Frank
Christien</i> one of Mr <i>Lowe's</i> Scholars came to visit <i>Harry</i> &amp; <i>Bob</i>, so
that I discharged them about eleven, &amp; retired to my Chamber to
writing&mdash;I sent Mr <i>George Lee</i> a note this morning begging him to
excuse <i>Ben</i> &amp; I from attending his Fish-Feast this Day&mdash;Captain
<i>Dobby</i> dined with us; he is a Man of much Spirit and Humour: A
great Mimick&mdash;He acquainted us that at Hobbs's-Hole this Day is a
Boat-Race on the River Rappahannock Each Boat is to have 7 Oars:
to row 2 Mile out &amp; 2 Miles in round a Boat lying at Anchor&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Bett 50&mdash;And that in the Evening there is a great Ball to be given&mdash;I
believe both the <i>Rowers</i> &amp; <i>dancers</i>, as well <i>Ladies</i> as <i>Gentlemen</i>
will perspire freely&mdash;Or in plain English they will soak in Sweat!
The Captain invited us on Board his Ship next Teusday to Dine with
him &amp; wish them a pleasant Passage as the Ship is to Sail the day following&mdash;If
the Weather is not too burning hot I shall go provided
the Others go likewise. Ben towards evening rode to Colonel
Tayloe's&mdash;</p>

River Nominy&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Monday August 1st 1774.</i></p>

<p>The Colonel rode to Richmond Court&mdash;The morning very hot&mdash;A
Cloud appeared about two o Clock as we were going to Dinner in
the West where it thundered&mdash;Mrs. <i>Carter</i> kept her Chamber&mdash;There
is almost no Rain&mdash;I looked to day over Dr <i>Burney's</i> present State of
Musick in Germany&mdash;I think it more entertaining than realy useful&mdash;Ben
to Day begun the <i>Eneid</i>&mdash;Poor Mr <i>Randolph</i> seems to be sickening
with the <i>Ague</i> &amp; <i>Fever</i>!&mdash;Evening the Colonel returned &amp; gave
us Captain Dobby's repeated Invitation.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 2.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> &amp; I drest ourselves pretty early with an intention to Breakfast
with Colonel <i>Tayloe</i>, but the Servant who went with us was so slow
in preparing that we breakfasted before we set out&mdash;We arrived at
Colonel Tayloe's however by half after nine&mdash;The young Ladies we
found in the Hall playing the Harpsichord&mdash;The morning cool with
a fine Breeze from the North for I forgot to mention that about
Midnight last Night a violent Gust of Blackness, Rain, &amp; Thunder
came on &amp; gave us present Relief from the scorching Sun; there was
no Dust &amp; the riding was pleasant&mdash;The Colonel, his Lady, Miss
Polly, Miss Kitty, Miss Sally, rode in their Great Coach to the Ferry&mdash;Distance
about 4 miles&mdash;Ben &amp; I on Horseback&mdash;From Colonel
Tayloe's to this Ferry opposite to Hobbs's Hole the Land is levil &amp;
extremely good; Corn here looks very rank is set thick with Ears, &amp;
they are high &amp; large, three commonly on a Stalk&mdash;Here I saw about
an Acre &amp; a half of Flax, which the people were just pulling, exceedingly
out of Season&mdash;This is the only Flax I have seen since I have
been in the Colony; I am told they raise much in the upper Counties&mdash;Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
too is a great Marsh covered with thick high Reed&mdash;The
Face of this part of the Country looks fertile, but I apprehend it is
far from being healthy&mdash;We came to the Bank of the Rappahannock;
it is here about 2 Miles over the Shipping on the other Side near the
Town lying at Anchor look fine; no large Vessels can haul along the
Wharves on account of shoal Water&mdash;There were six Ships riding in
the Harbour, and a number of Schooners &amp; smaller Vessels&mdash;Indeed,
says Mrs <i>Tayloe</i>, Captain Dobby has forgot us. here we have been
waiting for a full half hour, shall we take the Ferry Boat Colonel &amp;
cross over, &amp; not stand any longer in the burning heat?&mdash;I was pleased
not a little with the proposal tho' at the same time, I laughed with
myself at Mrs Tayloe's truely Womanish impatience!&mdash;At last they
are coming&mdash;The long-Boat came, well furnished with a large Awning,
and rowed with four Oars&mdash;We entered the Ship about half after
twelve where we were received by Captain Dobby, with every possible
token of welcome&mdash;Since I have been in Virginia, my inclination,
&amp; my fixed purpose before I left home, both of which were
very much assisted by a strict Attention to the instructing my little
Charge, these have kept me pretty constantly, almost wholly, indeed
out of that kind of Company where dissipation &amp; Pleasure have no
restraint&mdash;This entertainment of Captain Dobby's, elegant indeed, &amp;
exceeding agreeable, I consider as one among a prodigeous throng of
more powerful similar Causes, of the fevers &amp; other Disorders which
are common in this Colony, &amp; generally attributed to the Climate
which is thought to be noxious &amp; unhealthy. The Weather here indeed
is remarkably variable But taking away &amp; changing the usual &amp;
necessary Time of Rest; Violent Exercise of the Body &amp; Spirits; with
drinking great quantities of variety of Liquors, these bring on Virginia
Fevers&mdash;The Beaufort is a Stately Ship; Captain Dobby had an
Awning from the Stern over the Quarter quite to the Mizen-Mast,
which made great Room, kept off the Sun, &amp; yet was open on each
Side to give the Air a free passage. At three we had on Board about
45 Ladies, and about 60 Gentlemen besides the Ships Crew, &amp; Waiters
Servants &amp;c. We were not throng'd at all, &amp; dined all at twice&mdash;I was
not able to inform myself, because it seemed improper to interrupt
the General pleasure, with making circumstantial inquiries concerning
Individuals, &amp; saying pray, Sir, what young Lady is that yonder
in a Lute-String Gown? She seems genteel; where does her Father
live? Is she a Girl of Family &amp; Breeding? Has She any Suitors? This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
when one could not be out of the Inspection of the Company, would
have seemed impertinent so that I did not much enlarge my Acquaintance
with the Ladies, which commonly seems pleasing &amp; desirable to
me; But I took Notice of Several, &amp; shall record my remarks&mdash;The
Boats were to Start, to use the Language of Jockeys, immediately
after Dinner; A Boat was anchored down the River at a Mile
Distance&mdash;Captain <i>Dobby</i> and Captain <i>Benson</i> steer'd the Boats in
the Race&mdash;Captain <i>Benson</i> had 5 Oarsmen; Captain <i>Dobby</i> had 6&mdash;It
was <i>Ebb-Tide</i>&mdash;The Betts were small&mdash;&amp; chiefly given to the
Negroes who rowed&mdash;Captain Benson won the first Race&mdash;Captain
Purchace offered to bett ten Dollars that with the same Boat &amp; same
Hands, only having Liberty to put a small Weight in the Stern, he
would beat Captain <i>Benson</i>&mdash;He was taken, &amp; came out best only
half the Boats Length&mdash;About Sunset we left the Ship, &amp; went all to
Hobbs's Hole, where a <i>Ball</i> was agreed on&mdash;This is a small Village,
with only a few Stores, &amp; Shops, it is on a beautiful River, &amp; has I
am told commonly six, eight, &amp; ten Ships loading before it the Crews
of which enliven the Town&mdash;Mr Ritche<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Merchant; he has great
influence over the People, he has great Wealth; which in these scurvy
Times gives Sanction to Power; nay it seems to give countenance to
Tyranny&mdash;The Ball Room&mdash;25 Ladies&mdash;40 Gentlemen&mdash;The Room
very long, well-finished, airy &amp; cool, &amp; well-seated&mdash;two Fidlers&mdash;Mr
<i>Ritche</i> stalk'd about the Room&mdash;He was Director, &amp; appointed
a sturdy two fisted Gentleman to open the Ball with Mrs <i>Tayloe</i>&mdash;He
danced midling tho'. There were about six or eight married
Ladies&mdash;At last Miss <i>Ritche</i> danced a Minuet with &mdash;&mdash; She is a
tall slim Girl, dances nimble &amp; graceful&mdash;She was <i>Ben Carters</i> partner&mdash;Poor
Girl She has had the third Day Ague for twelve months past,
and has it yet She appeared in a blue Silk Gown; her Hair was done
up neat, without powder, it is very Black &amp; Set her to good Advantage&mdash;Soon
after he danced Miss <i>Dolly Edmundson</i><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>&mdash;A Short
pretty Stump of a Girl; She danced well, sung a Song with great
applause, seemed to enter into the Spirit of the entertainment&mdash;A
young Spark seemed to be fond of her; She seemed to be fond of
him; they were both fond, &amp; the Company saw it&mdash;He was Mr
Ritche's Clerk, a limber, well dress'd, pretty-handsome Chap he was&mdash;The
insinuating Rogue waited on her home, in close Hugg too, the
Moment he left the Ball-Room&mdash;Miss <i>Aphia Fantleroy</i> danced next,
the best Dancer of the whole absolutely&mdash;And the finest Girl&mdash;Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
head tho' was powdered white as Snow, &amp; crap'd in the newest
Taste&mdash;She is the Copy of the goddess of Modesty&mdash;Very handsome;
she seemed to be loved by all her Acquaintances, and admir'd
by every Stranger, Miss <i>McCall</i>&mdash;Miss <i>Ford</i>&mdash;Miss <i>Brokenberry</i><a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>&mdash;<i>Ball</i>&mdash;Two
of the younger Miss <i>Ritche's</i>&mdash;Miss <i>Wade</i>&mdash;They
danced till half after two. Captain Ritche invited Ben &amp; I, Colonel
Tayloe &amp; his Family with him&mdash;We got to Bed by three after a
Day spent in constant Violent exercise, &amp; drinking an unusual
Quantity of Liquor; for my part with Fatigue, Heat, Liquor, Noise,
Want of sleep, And the exertion of my Animal spirits, I was almost
brought to believe several times that I felt a Fever fixing upon me,
attended with every Symptom of the Fall Disorders&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 3.</i></p>

<p>We were call'd up to Breakfast at half after eight&mdash;We all look'd
dull, pale, &amp; haggard!&mdash;From our Beds to Breakfast&mdash;Here we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
drink hot Coffee on our parching Stomachs!&mdash;But the Company was
enlivening&mdash;Three of the Miss Tayloe's&mdash;Three Miss Ritche's&mdash;And
Miss <i>Fantleroy</i>&mdash;This loveliest of all the Ring is yet far below&mdash;<i>Laura</i>
If they were set together for the choice of an utter Stranger;
he would not reflect, but in a moment spring to the Girl that I mean
to regard&mdash;After Breakfast the young Ladies favoured us with several
Tunes on the Harpsichord&mdash;They all play &amp; most of them in good
Taste&mdash;at eleven we went down to the River; the Ships Long Boat
was waiting, Captain <i>Purchace</i> of the <i>Beaufort</i> helped us on Board&mdash;I
gave the Boatswain a Pisterene for his trouble&mdash;Half a Bit for the
Pasture of my Horse&mdash;We rode to Colonel Tayloe's&mdash;The Ladies all
retired for a nap before Dinner. We sat in the Hall, &amp; conversed with
the Colonel a sensible, agreeable Sociable person&mdash;Miss <i>Garrot</i> is
Governess of the Young Ladies; She too is chatty, satirical, neat, civil,
had many merry remarks at Dinner, we staid til about six took our
Leave, &amp; rode Home&mdash;Found all well; gave an account of ourselves,
of our entertainment, &amp; of our Company to Mr &amp; Mrs Carter at
Coffee&mdash;&amp; retired soon to Bed&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 4.</i></p>

<p>I made out to get up by seven&mdash;A little fatigued tho'&mdash;Many are
sickening with a Fever, &amp; great numbers have the Ague&mdash;Protect me
if it be thy will, God of my Life, &amp; give me a Heart to praise thy
name for all my Favours&mdash;Dined with us the Inspector&mdash;I walked
through the Garden, several times banishing by solitude, as much as
possible reflection on several Days past.&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 5.</i></p>

<p>I have no Stockings; &amp; I swear I wont go to the Dancing School
This was the first I heard of <i>Bob</i>&mdash;Are Bob &amp; Nancy gone to Mr
<i>Turberville's</i> said the Colonel at Breakfast&mdash;<i>Nancy</i> is gone Sir, Bob
stays at Home he has no shoes! poh! What nonsense! says the Colonel&mdash;Call
<i>Bob</i>, &amp; Call the Clerk&mdash;He sent Mr Randolph to the Store for
a pair of Shoes, Bob he took to his Study and flogg'd severely for not
having given seasonable Notice, &amp; sent him instantly to the Dance&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 6.</i></p>

<p>Last night, &amp; this morning haizy mistty the Wind South East
threatens a Rain&mdash;Transcribing my pieces, yesterday and to Day&mdash;I
had a strong invitation to Dr Thompsons Fish-Feast, but the Rainy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Weather hindred; I spent the Day in Quiet in my Chamber writing&mdash;Dadda
Gumbey sent me a small Water-Melon.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 7.</i></p>

<p>I set out for Church&mdash;It was cloudy, it Thundered in the West: But
I rode on Bob was with me&mdash;We arrived at the Church &amp; had our
Saddles put into a Chariot&mdash;When a violent Gust came on&mdash;We were
all in the Church; many Ladies were present&mdash;The Thunder was
violent! Many discovered great Terror&mdash;Neither the Parson, nor
Clerk attended&mdash;There we sat in Silence til the Storm was over,
when each sallied out &amp; splashed homewards&mdash;Mr &amp; Mrs Carter were
to have gone by Water&mdash;They had set off But saw the Cloud befor
they had rowed far, &amp; wisely returned&mdash;Towards Evening Miss
Betsy <i>Carter</i>, Miss Polly <i>Carter</i> of Richmond, &amp; Miss <i>Turberville</i>
came over to see our Girls. Miss Betsy plays the Harpsichord extremely
well, better I think than any young Lady I have seen in
Virginia.</p>


<p><i>Monday 8.</i></p>

<p>All once more in School&mdash;Dined with us <i>George Lee</i> &amp; Mr <i>Grubb</i>&mdash;They
spent the afternoon at the great House&mdash;After Coffee Lee
rode Home&mdash;Mr <i>Grubb</i> staid with us all night&mdash;Dennis came into
our Room to bring us a Bowl of Punch; Grubb shut the Door, and
accused him of having been caught with Bett, the Dairy Girl, in the
Stable last Saturday Night&mdash;Dennis seem'd in great distress, he denied
the Fact tho' with great steadiness&mdash;Nelson our Boy came in
with a candle&mdash;Dennis here, says <i>Grubb</i> to <i>Nelson</i>, has been accusing
you, Sir, of several crimes; he says you gave him half a <i>Bitt</i> last
Saturday Night, to stand at the Stable-Door while he with Bett&mdash;Nelson
star'd&mdash;Grubb opened a huge <i>Molls Atlas</i> that lay in the
Room; &amp; read off their Case &amp; indictment&mdash;The Boys seem'd crazy&mdash;We
dismiss'd them when all the novelty was over, but they darted
like Indians so soon as they were at liberty&mdash;We sat up til eleven&mdash;Ben
drank for his Toast, Miss <i>Julia Stockton</i> of New Jersey; Grubb

us that a Flux is in a neighbouring County, of which many die!&mdash;The
Ague too is growing frequent <i>Fanny</i> has a fit this afternoon&mdash;I
begin to be a little alarmed at the early approach of these Disorders,
which I fear will be distressful here!&mdash;Through the kindness of

<p>I never reflect, but with secret, and peculiar pleasure, on the time
when I studied in <i>Deerfield</i> with you, &amp; several other pleasant Companions,
under our common, &amp; much respected instructor, Mr <i>Green</i>.
And I acknowledge now, with a thankful heart, the many favours,
which I received from your family while I was a member of it. This
sense of obligation to your Family. And personal friendship for you,
have excited me, when it was in my power, to introduce you to the
business which I now occupy; into a family, where, if you be prudent
and industrious, I am confident you will speedily acquire to yourself
both Honour &amp; Profit&mdash;But inasmuch as you are wholly a stranger
to this Province; &amp; have had little or no Experience in the business
which you ar[e] shortly to enter upon; &amp; lest, from common Fame,
which is often erroneous, you shall have entertained other notions of
the manners of the People here, &amp; of your business as a Tutor, than
you will find, when you come, to be actually true; I hope you will
not think it <i>vain</i> or <i>untimely</i>, if I venture to lay before you some
Rules for your direction which I have collected from a year's observation.
I shall class what I have to say in the following order. First.
I shall attempt to give you some direction for the plan of your Conduct
among your neighbours, &amp; the People in General here, so long
as you sustain the character of a Tutor. Then I shall advise you concerning
the rules which I think will be most profitable &amp; convenient
in the management of your little lovely charge, the School. Last of
all. I shall mention several Rules for your personal conduct. I choose
to proceed in the order I have laid down, as well that you may more
fully &amp; speedily recieve my mind, as that you may also the more
readily select out and apply what you shall find to be most necessary.</p>

<p>First. When you have thought of removing, for a Time, out of
the Colony in which you was born, &amp; in which you have hitherto
constantly resided, I make no doubt but you have at the same time
expected to find a very considerable alteration of manners, among
your new acquaintances, &amp; some peculiarities toto Caelo different,
from any you have before been accustomed to. Such a thought is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
natural; And you will if you come into Virginia, in much shorter
time than a year, be convinced that it is just. In New-Jersey Government
throughout, but especially in the Counties where you have any
personal acquaintance, Gentlemen in the first rank of Dignity &amp;
Quality, of the Council, general Assembly, inferior Magistrates,
Clergy-men, or independent Gentlemen, without the smallest fear
of bringing any manner of reproach either on their office, or their
high-born, long recorded Families associate freely &amp; commonly
with Farmers &amp; Mechanicks tho' they be poor &amp; industrious. Ingenuity
&amp; industry are the Strongest, &amp; most approved recommendations
to a Man in that Colony. The manners of the People seem to
me, (probably I am overborn by the force of prejudice in favour
of my native Soil), to bear some considerable resemblance of the
manners in the ancient Spartan Common-Wealth&mdash;The Valour of its
Inhabitants&mdash;was the best, &amp; only security of that State against the
enemy; &amp; the wise laws of its renowned Legislator were the powerful
Cement which kept them firm &amp; invincible&mdash;In our Government,
the laborious part of Men, who are commonly ranked in the midling
or lower Class, are accounted the strenth &amp; Honour of the Colony;
&amp; the encouragement they receive from Gentlemen in the highest
stations is the spring of Industry, next to their private advantage.
The Levil which is admired in New-Jersey Government, among
People of every rank, arises, no doubt, from the very great division
of the lands in that Province, &amp; consequently from the near approach
to an equality of Wealth amongst the Inhabitants, since it is not famous
for trade. You know very well that the Lands in a small township
are divided, &amp; then again subdivided into two &amp; three Hundred
Separate, proper, creditable estates; for example <i>Deerfield</i> &amp; <i>Fairfield</i>
two Townships, or Precincts, in which you &amp; I are tolerably well
acquainted, in the former of which, are the Seats of two Judges of
the Sessions; &amp; in the latter resides one of the representatives in
General Assembly for the County; But if 16000 would purchase
the whole landed estates of these three Gentlemen, who are supposed
to be the most wealthy in the County, if we rate their Land
at the Low Consideration of 4 per acre, with all conveniences,
each would have 4000 Acres. Now you may suppose how small
a quantity many must have when two or three hundred Landholders
reside in each of these small Precincts; Hence we see Gentlemen,
when they are not actually engaged in the publick Service, on their
farms, setting a laborious example to their Domesticks, &amp; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
other hand we see labourers at the Tables &amp; in the Parlours of their
Betters enjoying the advantage, &amp; honour of their society and Conversation&mdash;I
do not call it an objection to this, that some few, who
have no substance but work like Slaves as nec[e]ssity drives them
for a few Months in the year; with the price of this Labour they
visit Philadelphia; &amp; having there acquired a fashionable Coat, &amp; a
Stock of Impudence, return home to spend the remainder of the
year, in idleness &amp; disgrace!&mdash;But you will find the tables turned
the moment you enter this Colony. The very Slaves, in some families
here, could not be bought under 30000. Such amazing property,
no matter how deep it is involved, blows up the owners to an imagination,
which is visible in all, but in various degrees according to
their respective virtue, that they are exalted as much above other
Men in worth &amp; precedency, as blind stupid fortune has made a difference
in their property; excepting always the value they put upon
posts of honour, &amp; mental acquirements&mdash;For example, if you should
travel through this Colony, with a well-confirmed testimonial of
your having finished with Credit a Course of studies at Nassau-Hall;
you would be rated, without any more questions asked, either
about your family, your Estate, your business, or your intention, at
10,000; and you might come, &amp; go, &amp; converse, &amp; keep company,
according to this value; &amp; you would be dispised &amp; slighted if yo[u]
rated yourself a farthing cheaper. But when I am giving directions
to you, from an expectation that you will be shortly a resident here,
altho you have gone through a College Course, &amp; for any thing I
know, have never written a Libel, nor stolen a Turkey, yet I think
myself in duty bound to advise you, lest some powdered Coxcomb
should reproach your education, to cheapen your price about 5000;
because any young Gentleman travelling through the Colony, as I
said before, is presum'd to be acquainted with Dancing, Boxing, playing
the Fiddle, &amp; Small-Sword, &amp; Cards. Several of which you was
only entering upon, when I left New-Jersey; towards the Close of
last year; and if you stay here any time your Barrenness in these must
be detected. I will however allow, that in the Family where you act
as tutor you place yourself, according to your most accute Calculation,
at a perfect equidistance between the father &amp; the eldest Son.
Or let the same distance be observed in every article of behaviour
between you &amp; the eldest Son, as there ought to be, by the latest &amp;
most approved precepts of Moral-Philosophy, between the eldest
Son, &amp; his next youngest Brother. But whenever you go from Home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
where you are to act on your own footing, either to a Ball; or to a
<i>Horse-Race</i>, or to a <i>Cock-Fight</i>, or to a <i>Fish-Feast</i>, I advise that you
rate yourself very low, &amp; if you bett at all, remember that 10,000
in Reputation &amp; learning does not amount to a handfull of Shillings
in ready Cash!&mdash;One considerable advantage which you promise
yourself by coming to this Colony is to extend the Limits of your
acquaintance; this is laudable, &amp; if you have enough of prudence &amp;
firmness, it will be of singular advantage&mdash;Yet attempt slowly &amp;
with the most Jealous Circumspection&mdash;If you fix your familiarity
wrong in a single instance, you are in danger of total, if not immediate
ruin&mdash;You come here, it is true, with an intention to teach,
but you ought likewise to have an inclination to learn. At any rate
I solemnly injoin it upon you, that you never suffer the spirit of a
Pedagogue to attend you without the walls of your little Seminary.
In all promiscuous Company be as silent &amp; attentive as Decency will
allow you, for you have nothing to communicate, which such company,
will hear with pleasure, but you may learn many things which,
in after life, will do you singular service.&mdash;In regard to Company
in general, if you think it worth the while to attend to my example,
I can easily instruct you in the manner of my Conduct in this respect.
I commonly attend Church; and often, at the request of Gentlemen,
after Service according to the custom, dine abroad on Sunday&mdash;I
seldom fail, when invited by Mr or Mrs <i>Carter</i>, of going out
with them; but I make it a point, however strongly solicited to the
contrary, to return home with them too&mdash;Except in one of these
cases, I seldom go out, but with a valuable variety of books I live according
to Horace's direction, &amp; love "Secretum Iter et fallentis
Semita Vitae." Close retirement and a life by Stealth. The last direction
I shall venture to mention on this head, is, that you abstain
totally from Women. What I would have you understand from this,
is, that by a train of faultless conduct in the whole course of your
tutorship, you make every Lady within the Sphere of your acquaintance,
who is between twelve &amp; forty years of age, so much
pleased with your person, &amp; so fully satisfied as to your abilities in
the capacity of&mdash;a Teacher; &amp; in short, fully convinced, that, from a
principle of Duty, you have, both by night &amp; by day endeavoured
to acquit yourself honourably, in the Character of a Tutor; &amp; that,
on this account, you have their free &amp; hearty consent, without making
any manner of demand upon you, either to stay longer in the
County with them, which they would choose, or whenever your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
business calls you away, that they may not have it in their Power
either by charms or Justice to detain you, &amp; when you must leave
them, have their sincere wishes &amp; constant prayrs for Length of
days &amp; much prosperity, I therefore beg that you will attend litterally
to this advice, &amp; abstain totally from Women. But this last
precaution, which I have been at some pains to dress in the plainest
language, I am much inclined to think, will be wholly useless in regard
to you, notwithstanding it is founded in that <i>Honour</i> and
<i>Equity</i> which is on all hands allow'd to be due from one Sex to the
other, &amp; to many of your <i>age</i>, &amp; <i>Standing</i> no doubt would be entirely
salutary. Because the necessary connections which you have
had with the Fair, from your Puberty upwards have been so unfavourable
&amp; ill-fated, that instead of apprehending any danger on
the score of over fondness, I am fearful your rancour has grown so
inveterate at length, as, not only to preserve you, in thought &amp; practice,
pure of every Fleshly foible, but has carried you so far towards
the other extream, as that you will need many persuasions, when
your circumstances shall seem to require it, to bring you back to a
rational &amp; manly habit of thinking &amp; acting with respect to the Sex;
which yet, after all (&amp; eternally will continue to be, tho it is so much
courted &amp; whined after) if considered in the fullest manner, &amp; set
forth to the best advantage, never rises above its divine definition
viz "The weaker Vessel." But without detaining you any longer
with a matter merely depending on accident or Circumstance I pass
on to the second General Head; in which "Ludis atque Jocis amotis
[amatis]" I shall offer to your consideration &amp; recommend for your
practice several Rules concerning the managment of the School.</p>

<p>2. You will act wisely, if, from the begining, you convince all your
Scholars which you may easily do, of your abilities in the several
branches, which you shall profess to teach; you are not to tell them,
totidem Verbis, "that you understand, perhaps as well as any man
on the Continent both the Latin &amp; Greek Classicks;" "&amp; have gone
through the usual Course in the noted College of New-Jersey, under
Dr Witherspoon, so universally known &amp; admired, where you
have studied Criticism, Oratory, History, not to mention Mathematical
&amp; philosophical Studies, &amp; dipt a good way into the French-Language,
&amp; that you have learn'd a smattering of Dancing, Cards &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c." For Dun-p or Hack&mdash;-n or the most profound dunce in
your College or School would have too much sense to pass such impudence
by, &amp; not despise and reproach it; but you may speedily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>&amp;
certainly make them think you a "Clever Fellow" (which is a phrase
in use here for a good Scholar) if you never mention any thing before
them, only what you seem to be wholly master of&mdash;This will
teach them never to dispute your determination, &amp; always to rely
upon your Judgment; two things which are most essential for your
peace, &amp; their advantage. That you may avoid yourself of this with
certainty I shall recommend for your practice the following method,
as useful at least, if not intirely necessary. Read over carefully, the
lessons in Latin &amp; Greek, in your leisure hours, that the story &amp; Language
be fresh in your memory, when you are hearing the respective
lessons; for your memory is treacherous, &amp; I am pretty certain it
would confound you if you should be accosted by a pert School-Boy,
in the midst of a blunder, with "Physician heal thyself"!&mdash;You
ought likewise to do this with those who are working Figures; probably
you may think that because the highest Cypherer is only in decimal
arithmetic, it is not there fore worth your critical attention to be
looking previously into the several Sums. But you are to consider
that a sum in the Square-Root, or even in the Single Rule of three
direct, is to your Pupils of as great importance, as the most abstruse
problem in the Mathematicks to an able artist; &amp; you may lay this
down for a Maxim, that they will reckon upon your abilities, according
as they find you acquainted &amp; expert in what they themselves are
studying. If therefore you have resolution (as I do not question your
ability) to carry this plan which I have laid down into execution;
you will thereby convince them of the propriety of their Subordination
to you, &amp; obedience to your instructions, so that you may
lead them, without any resistance, and fix them to the Study of whatever
Science you think proper, in which they will rise according to
their respective Capacities. I have said that you ought to strive "from
the beginning" in fixing this very material article in the minds of
your Scholars, Viz a Sense of your authority; for one error of Judgment,
or false determination will diminish your Ability with them
more than doing forty things with truth would increase your authority&mdash;They
act in this case as you would do in the company of a
number of Strangers&mdash;A whole evenings conversation, if it was tolerable
good Sense, would perhaps make little or no impression on you;
But if through hast[e] in speaking, or inattention, any one should let
fall a sentence either remarkably foolish, or grossly wicked, it would
be difficult if not impossible to persuade you presently that the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was not either a <i>thick-Scull</i>, or a <i>Villain</i>!&mdash;The education of children
requires constant unremitting attention. The meanest qualification
you can mention in a useful teacher is <i>diligence</i> And without
diligence no possible abilities or qualifications can bring children on
either with speed or profit. There must be a Combination of qualifications
which must all operate strongly &amp; uniformly. In short, give
this said Pedagogizing the softest name you will, it is still a "difficult
Task." You will meet with numberless difficulties, in your new imployment,
which you never dreamt had yet existence. All these you
must endeavour to resist &amp; Subdue. This I have seen compared to a
Man swimming against a current of Water. But I am mistaken if
you will agree, after having six months practice, that the comparison
be strong as the truth: You will add to the figure, I am certain, &amp;
throw into the Current sharp fragments of <i>Ice</i>, &amp; <i>Blocks</i>, which
would make swimming not only difficult but dangerous! I am not
urging these things to discourage you; they are hints for your direction,
which, if you will attend to, tho' at first the practice seem rough
&amp; unpleasant, shall yet make the remainder of your task pleasing, &amp;
the whole of it useful, I will mention several of these Obstacles that
you may the more easily guard against them. You will, in the first
place, be often solicited, probably oftner than you would wish, to
ride abroad; this, however, if you do it moderately, &amp; in seasonable
time, &amp; go to proper company, I recommend as conducive to health
to one in your sedentary manner of living. But if you go much into
company, you will find it extremely difficulty to break away with
any manner of credit till very late at night or in most cases for several
days, &amp; if you are wanting to your School, you do manifest injury
to your Imployer. In this case, I advise you to copy Mr <i>Carter</i>.
Whenever he invites you, ride. You may <i>stay</i>, and talk, &amp; drink,
&amp; ride to as great excess as he; &amp; may with safety associate yourself
with those whom you find to be his intimates. In all other Cases, except
when you ride to Church, at least till you are very intimate in
the Colony, you had better ride to a certain Stump, or to some noted
plantation, or pretty landscape; you will have in this every advantage
of exercise, the additional advantage of undisturbed Meditation, &amp;
you will be under no Jealous apprehension in point of behaviour, nor
any restraint as to the time of your return.</p>

<p>Another current difficulty will be petitions for holidays. You must
have good deal of steadiness if you are able to evade cleverly this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
practice which has grown so habitual to your little charge from a
false method in their early education that they absolutely claim it
as a necessary right.</p>

<p>You must also as much as you can, avoid visible partiality. At least
you must never suffer your fondness for one Scholar to grow so
manifest, as that all your School shall see you look over a fault in
him or her which same fault, if commited by another, you severely
chastise. This will certainly produce in the others hatred &amp; contempt.
A fourth difficulty, and the last I shall mention, consists in
knowing when, &amp; in what measure to give the Boys Liberty to go
from Home. The two younger Boys are wholly under your inspection;
so that not only the progress they make in learning, but their
moral Conduct (for both of these are critically observed &amp; examined)
either justifies or condemns your management to the World. If you
keep them much at home, &amp; close to business, they themselves will
call you unfeeling and cruel; &amp; refuse to be industrious; if you suffer
them to go much abroad they are certainly out of the way of improvement
by Study, probably, by discovering their gross Ignorance,
they will expose to ridicule both themselves &amp; all their former
instructors, &amp; possibly they may commit actual Crimes so as very
much to injure themselves; &amp; scandalize their family; but in each of
these you will have a large share of blame, perhaps more than the
parents, or even the Boys themselves&mdash;It will be said that the parents
gave them no licence relying wholly on your judgment &amp; prudence,
this will in good measure justify them to the world. And as to the
Boys they are full of youthful impetuosity &amp; vigour, &amp; these compel
them, when they are free of restraint, to commit actions which with
proper management they had surely avoided. I say, when you lay
these things together, &amp; view them on every side you will find so
many perplexities arising in your mind, from a sense of ignorance
of your duty, that you will proceed with caution &amp; moderation, &amp;
will be carefull to examine with some precision into the circumstances
of <i>time</i>, <i>company</i>, &amp; <i>Business</i> when you license them to go
out entirely at the risk of your Reputation&mdash;But the practice of three
or four Weeks will give you a more full notion of these &amp; many
other incidents than I am able now either to recollect or express; I
shall have gained my End if these hints prevent you from setting
off wrong, &amp; doing inadvertantly at first what your Scholars will
assert to be precedents for your after conduct. I go on, therefore, in
the third place as I proposed,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
3. To mention several Rules for your personal conduct. The happy
Education which you have had in point of religion, you ought to
consider as an important and distinguishing Blessing of Heaven. That
train of useful <i>Instruction</i>, <i>Advice</i> &amp; <i>Example</i> to which you have
been accustomed from your infancy is a more perfect, &amp; will be a
safer guide in your future walk, than any directions I am able to give
you. You have taken notice of a method for Assistance in Composition,
which Longinus recommends. Place, says he, in imagination, several
eminent ancient Authors before your Eyes, &amp; suppose that they inspect
your Work, a Sense of inferiority would make you diligent, &amp;
your composition accurate. Perhaps the same advice when transferr'd
to Morality, would be equally salutary. Unless it be objected that a
Belief of Gods presence at all times in every place is the strongest
possible restraint against committing Sin. This I constantly admit;
but when I consider how easily our minds are put in motion,
&amp; how strongly they are sometimes agitated merely by the senses,
&amp; that the senses are affected most by things which fall under their
immediate notice, I am fully convinced that if some such plan as I
have just mentioned should be fallen upon, &amp; practised, it would
make a visible and useful change in our behaviour&mdash;In this place I
think it needful to caution you against hasty &amp; ill founded prejudices.
When you enter among a people, &amp; find that their manner of living,
their <i>Eating</i>, <i>Drinking</i>, <i>Diversions</i>, <i>Exercise</i> &amp;c., are in many respects
different from any thing you have been accustomed to, you will be
apt to fix your opinion in an instant, &amp; (as some divines deal with
poor Sinners) you will condemn all before you without any meaning
or distinction what seems in your Judgment disagreable at first
view, when you are smitten with the novelty. You will be making
ten thousand Comparisons. The face of the Country, The <i>Soil</i>, the
<i>Buildings</i>, the <i>Slaves</i>, the <i>Tobacco</i>, the method of spending <i>Sunday</i>
among Christians; <i>Ditto</i> among the Negroes; the three grand divisions
of time at the Church on Sundays, Viz. before Service giving &amp; receiving
letters of business, reading Advertisements, consulting about
the price of Tobacco, Grain &amp;c. &amp; settling either the lineage, Age, or
qualities of favourite Horses 2. In the Church at Service, prayrs read
over in haste, a Sermon seldom under &amp; never over twenty minutes,
but always made up of sound morality, or deep studied Metaphysicks.
3. After Service is over three quarters of an hour spent in strolling
round the Church among the Crowd, in which time you will be
invited by several different Gentlemen home with them to dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
The Balls, the Fish-Feasts, the Dancing-Schools, the Christnings,
the Cock fights, the Horse-Races, the Chariots, the Ladies Masked,
for it is a custom among the Westmorland Ladies whenever they go
from home, to muffle up their heads, &amp; Necks, leaving only a narrow
passage for the Eyes, in Cotton or silk handkerchiefs; I was in distress
for them when I first came into the Colony, for every Woman that
I saw abroad, I looked upon as ill either with the <i>Mumps</i> or Tooth-Ach!&mdash;I
say, you will be often observing &amp; comparing these things
which I have enumerated, &amp; many more that now escape me, with
the manner of spending Money time &amp; credit at Cohansie: You are
young, &amp;, (you will allow me the Expression) in the morning of
Life. But I hope you have plann'd off, and entered upon the work
which is necessary to be performed in the course of your Day; if
not, I think it my duty to acquaint you, that a combination of the
amusements which I have just now mentioned, being always before
your Eyes, &amp; inviting your Compliance will have a strong tendency
to keep you doubtful &amp; unsetled, in your notions of Morality &amp;
Religion, or else will fix you in a false &amp; dangerous habit of <i>thinking</i>
&amp; <i>acting</i>, which must terminate at length in Sorrow &amp; despair. You
are therefore, if you count any thing upon the value of my advice, to
fix the plan in which you would spend your life; let this be done
with deliberation, Candour, &amp; precission, looking to him for direction,
by fervent Prayr, who is the "Wonderful Counsellor;" &amp; when
you have done this, let no importunity of whatever kind prevail over
you, &amp; cause you to transgress your own Limitations. I have already
exceeded the usual bounds of an Epistle. But you will easily pardon
a little prolixity, when I assure you it flows from a heart deeply impressed
with a sense of the many difficulties which you must encounter,
&amp; the dangers which will surround you when you come
first out from the peaceful recess of Contemplation, &amp; enter, young
and unexperienced, into the tumultuous undiscerning World. I submit
these hints to your consideration, &amp; have nothing more than
sincere &amp; ardent wishes for your present &amp; perpetual Felicity.</p>

came in Colonel <i>Henry Lee</i><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> He is chosen to be one of the
seven who represent this Colony in the general Congress to be held
next Month in Philadelphia&mdash;He sets out next Sunday Sennight&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 14.</i></p>

<p>Colonel Lee stays Breakfast (to Speak in the phrase of Ladies)&mdash;The
morning fine&mdash;Sermon is to Day at Ucomico so that I am to stay
in my Room; <i>Ben</i>, however, &amp; <i>Bob</i>, &amp; <i>Harry</i>, &amp; Mr <i>Randolph</i> all go&mdash;<i>Fanny</i>
is yet confin'd to her Chamber&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Monday 15.</i></p>

<p>Began a Letter to Jack Peck, giving him advice in Respect to his coming
into this Colony&mdash;The People are better, only Miss <i>Fanny</i> with
her Sores continues in her Chamber; I bought &amp; sent her however this
evening a present a large <i>Musk Melon</i>&mdash;Dined with us Squire <i>Lee</i>,
he talks of going to Philadelphia to the Congress; He informs us
that in Maryland is a Tea-Ship, from the India Company&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 16.</i></p>

<p>The Colonel is summoned to a Meeting of Vestry-Men, at the Glebe&mdash;Nothing
very extraordinary occurs, unless I mention that <i>Bob</i>
in the former part of this Day kept pretty quiet in his Seat, and
worked out three Sums in Reduction compound, without much
direction!&mdash;About five from the South East came on suddenly a
Gust of Rain &amp; Wind, Evening the Colonel returned but a good deal
vexed&mdash;One of the Members were absent so that the Remainder
could do no Business&mdash;</p>

<p>This Day is the annual Examination at Nassau-Hall&mdash;I wish the
Candidates Success &amp; Honour. Last year I had the Pleasure to be
present &amp; hear the Examination&mdash;I saw <i>Laura</i> too; &amp; the Vixen abused
me! She shall repent of that insult; Indeed She must feel, tho' I
wound myself in the experiment, the Consequence of Slighting good-humour
&amp; Civility&mdash;There likewise I saw <i>Belinda</i> my late agreeable
Correspondent. She had left town this unlovely Month, for the benefit
of Princeton's pure salubrious Air&mdash;She laboured in a Consumption
There too I took my last fare-well!&mdash;For soon after her return
to Town the disorder fixed, &amp; in a few Months destroy'd a <i>wise</i>,
<i>useful</i>, <i>religious</i> Girl&mdash;Her death surely was untimely, since she took
with her all her virtues, which, with great pleasure &amp; Sincerity She
used to diffuse among her giddy Equals!&mdash;I am at a Loss to express
my feeling for the Death of a young Lady, with whom I had only
a short, yet a benificial Intimacy&mdash;The Circumstance of my first
Acquaintance with her was wholly Accidental, yet I soon believed
&amp; accounted it advantageous&mdash;I thought her capable of improving
me with Sentiment, &amp; I speedily found that my expectation was true&mdash;We
commenced a Litterary Correspondence, of which I only
say that She always express'd herself with so much Truth, Ease &amp;
Humour as to make me read her Letters with eagerness and satisfaction&mdash;If
I would record a Motto for her, it Should be&mdash;"Virtue
without Melancholy." Breakfasted &amp; dined with us two Gentlemen
from Maryland&mdash;They come over for the benefit of Mr <i>Carter's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Mill; as Mills are scarce near the Potowmack in Maryland; but the
reason I am a stranger to&mdash;Read some in Dr Swift&mdash;Writing on to
Mr Peck&mdash;The weather is close &amp; this evening I heard two Musquetoes,
only one of which ventured to light upon me&mdash;I dare say
they are thicker at Cohansie!&mdash;Each Wednesday &amp; Saturday we
dine on Fish all the Summer, always plenty of <i>Rock</i>, <i>Perch</i>, &amp; <i>Crabs</i>,
&amp; often Sheeps-Head and Trout!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 18.</i></p>

<p>Very ill most of last night with a violent Dysentery; I fear a frequency
of this disease will at-length fix &amp; ruin me&mdash;It continues to
Day, &amp; with no less rage, I cannot eat nor drink, am low Spirited
Think constantly of Home;&mdash;Sometimes repent my having come
into this Colony, &amp; blame myself for having been persuaded to turn
out of my road to public Business&mdash;But when I reflect closely I
justify the Conduct, &amp; resign myself <i>Body</i> &amp; <i>Soul</i> &amp; <i>Employment</i>
to God who has the Hearts of all in his hand, &amp; who I am persuaded,
if he has any thing for me to do in Life, will preserve, &amp; in a measure
fit me for it, if not, I am in his Hand, let him do as seemes good
in his Eyes&mdash;At Dinner the Colonel invited me to ride with him to a
Mill of his which is repairing, about eight miles Distance; I accepted
his Invitation, gave the children a few Hours for Play, &amp;
went with the Colonel <i>Ben</i> was along&mdash;The Face of the earth seems
covered with mocking-Birds, but not one of them sing, they seem
vastly busy but it is in collecting Food&mdash;Not a bird, except now &amp;
then <i>Robbin-Redbreast</i> is heard to sing in this Feverish Month&mdash;Nature
seems cheerless and gloomy! The Evening is hot, but the
Ride was agreeable, it was useful too; for I grow much better; The
Jolting of the Horse seemed salutary, my Pain subsided, I returned
almost wholly relieved in the evening, drank my Coffee, went soon
to my Room, gave thanks to my divine <i>restorer</i> &amp; laid me down to
rest&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 19.</i></p>

<p>I slept through the night in <i>quiet</i> and ease, &amp; rose perfectly relieved
Mr <i>Carter</i> at Breakfast advised me to take with him Some <i>Salt-Petre</i>,
as a useful Dieuretick but I declin'd&mdash;Mr <i>Grubb</i> came in about
twelve o-Clock from <i>Sabine-Hall</i>. Colonel <i>Carter</i> gave an Entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Yesterday to celebrate his Birth-Day; &amp; had a numerous &amp;
gay Company.&mdash;This young Gentleman (Mr <i>Grubb</i>) appears to be
a person of Capacity &amp; Improvement; he was Educated in England,
&amp; has been assistant to a Merchant on <i>James's River</i> in this Colony
for some time past. This Summer he has been totally Idle&mdash;He proposes
week after week to set out for Williamsburg, &amp; Sail thence
home, but he stays. He has much good nature, is an agreeable companion&mdash;I
pity him.&mdash;He seems fond of Miss <i>Betsy Lee</i>&mdash;But he is
too fluctuating in his mind to settle there, or with any Girl whatever
Yet&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 20.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> Mr <i>Taylor</i>, Mr <i>Grubb</i>, &amp; <i>Harry</i> went to the Potowmack to a
Fish Feast&mdash;Come, Fithian, what do you mean by keeping hived up
sweating in your Room&mdash;Come out &amp; air yourself&mdash;But I choose to
stick by the Stuff. The Colonel too, very kindly, offered me
a Seat in his Chariot to Nomini Court-House, but I declin'd Mr Lane
&amp; Mr Warden came in towards evening&mdash;Both in high Spirits. But
Mr <i>Lane</i> was (as they say) "Half Seas over"&mdash;they sat &amp; chated
noisily til nine&mdash;Evening clear a full Moon, &amp; very light&mdash;Our neighbourhood
seems alive with little Negro Boys playing in every part&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 21.</i></p>

<p>Nomini Church&mdash;Parson Smith gave us after Prayrs, which he
was obliged to read himself, a useful Sermon; poor man he seemed to
labour hard&mdash;Dined with us Captain <i>Walker</i>, Mr <i>Lane</i>, Mrs <i>Lane</i>,
Mr <i>Wadman</i>, Mr <i>Warden</i>.</p>

<p>Soon after Dinner I left the company &amp; retired to my chamber
where I seem commonly most happy&mdash;</p>

Virginia is liberty&mdash;And the universal topic politicks&mdash;I suppose it to

but to present you my best regards, remember me to your sister&mdash;To
Miss Cunningham&mdash;The Miss Armitages&mdash;Miss Cooks&mdash;I hope to see
you the last of october, when I expect to be in Town&mdash;Probably you
can make it convenient for you to take a ramble into the country at
that time. I hope to be at leisure, and shall be proud to attend you&mdash;Mr
Blain, who favours me by carrying these is a Gentleman of my acquaintance
in this Colony, a Merchant of Note, I shall thank you if you
will take some notice of him,&mdash;And by him, as he is to return immediately
I beg you write&mdash;Tell me how matters go in Town&mdash;Tell me

<p>I wrote you a line in great haste, just before I left home, and two
days before that I had the pleasure of your company with ladies in
an evening excursion&mdash;We have here no artificial gardens; Nor can
we select out a company of sociable equals whenever we are in a
humour for a walk&mdash;Here we either strain on Horseback from home
to Church, or from house to House if we go out at all&mdash;Or we walk
alone into a dark Meadow, or tall wood&mdash;But I love solitude, and
these lonely recesses suit exactly the feeling of my mind&mdash;I recieved
lately a letter from Cohansie, in which I am informed of the Death
of Uncle <i>Seeley</i>&mdash;The family and neighbourhood will have suffered
a great loss!&mdash;I suppose you join in the general language, and assert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
your liberties and oppose oppression. I hope at least you are on the
right side of the question.</p>

<p>The City, I dare say, is in great tumult if not in consternation. I wish
it was convenient for me to be in town when the gentlemen from the
respective Colonies shall meet in general Congress&mdash;This is out of
my power, but I can wish for their union, and usefulness. Mr <i>Blain</i>,
the gentleman who forwards my letter, is a Merchant of Note, in this
Colony, you will oblige me if you take notice of him while he is in
Town.&mdash;You will not fail to write me a line, and give to Mr Blain
the moment you recieve mine, least he leave town and I be disappointed.</p>

<p>I send you these inclosed in a line to your Brother.</p>

<p>I do this that you may recieve the letter, for there seems to be little
security in a letter directed to you, the youngsters are so curious
to examine what is written for you&mdash;I understand that you never
recieved my last dated "May 1774. Delaware River on board the
swallow." I wish I could detect the impudent interceptor&mdash;You
have then at last condescended to visit Cohansie! I hear by Mr <i>Ewing</i>
that you was in the Country several weeks&mdash;Does it delight you, to
hear the noise of Birds, of Lowing Cows, of Sheep, and of chatt'ring
poultry, instead of the City-Cries? But I forget myself&mdash;Did you
see that your Merchant, who, as I mentioned to you, is so moved
with youn[g] person and manner? I suppose he was your constant
and unwearied gallant&mdash;I expect that according to promise, you
spent some part of your time with my sister&mdash;She a little Vixen, has
never scribbled me a line, but I am level with her, for I have been as
silent as she&mdash;Miss Beatty, that girl you seem so passionately fond of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
is I expect, before this returned&mdash;She is indeed a lovely girl, if I say
more you will call me partial&mdash;At any rate, as you correspond, I
beg you will present her with my compliments, which are indeed
but empty, thread-bare things&mdash;But Madam, I assure you they are
the most valuable articles I can now transmit&mdash;I expect to be in town
by the latter end of October, or beginning of November&mdash;If you
are not too busy when you recieve this, I beg you will sit yourself
instantly down and write me a friendly answer&mdash;This I think my
due since I have written to you only, and to no other Lady either in
town or country</p>

<p>Since I left you I have heard not a syllable about you, whether the
ague has left you, whether you have left the City removed to
Alexandria, as you proposed in the spring, in short both yourself and
fame have been, as to you, wholly silent&mdash;</p>

<p>I have now an oppertunity which I gladly improve of sending you a

Answer&mdash;There are many from this Colony to attend the general
Congress, seven by appointment, the others out of curiosity, by Mr
<i>Blain</i>, a gentleman of my acquaintance in this Colony, a Merchant of
Note I forward this; you will oblige me if you use him with civility.&mdash;</p>

<p>I cannot write home at present; if you should write soon to Cohansie,
please to mention to whoever you write to that I am in good health;
that the neighbourhood is in good health; and that I propose to return
about the latter end of october&mdash;I can transmit nothing now
concerning public affairs, you will know by the gentlemen from
this province that the reigning spirit is liberty&mdash;I hope Mr and Mrs
Hollinshead keep clear of the fevers this fall; but I fear they will suffer
in that common calamity. I think they ought to remove to the
City for a few weeks in september when the disorder rages where
they reside&mdash;My best compliments attend your family, and to Miss

Weeks I suppose they will grow numerous &amp; troublesome&mdash;A violent
Gust of Wind, Rain, &amp; some Thunder we had about twelve

<p>Stormy&mdash;A poor Man arrived from Maryland with Grain to grind.
It was wet&mdash;He saw Mr Carter and Mr <i>Randolph</i>&mdash;Mr Randolph
wore a red Coat&mdash;the Marylander asked <i>Bob</i> which was the master
of the House&mdash;<i>Bob</i> with his usual impudence answered, the Man you
see drest in a scarlet Coat&mdash;Who then says he is the other in a frowsled
Wig?&mdash;He is says <i>Bob</i> my fathers Clerk&mdash;The Colonel heard this
Anecdote of <i>Bob</i>, which entertained him, While we were dining. I
hear nothing of the Ague abroad, it seems to go by turns, sometimes
brief then exceeding scarce&mdash;all this day the wind North East rainy.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 25.</i></p>

<p>Still stormy. The Gentlemen who are sailing up the Bay to the Congress
have a disagreeable time&mdash;This is a true August Northeaster, as
we call it in Cohansie&mdash;<i>Ben</i> is in a wonderful <i>Fluster</i> lest he shall
have no company to-morrow at the Dance&mdash;But blow high, blow
low, he need not be afraid; <i>Virginians</i> are of genuine Blood&mdash;They
will dance or die!&mdash;I wrote some at my Letter for Mr <i>Peck</i>&mdash;The
people here pronounce Shower "Sho-er"&mdash;And what in New-Jersey
we call a Vendue here they a "Sale"&mdash;All Taverns they call "Ordinary's"&mdash;When
a Horse is frolicsome &amp; brisk, they, say at once he
is "gayly"&mdash;she [if he] is mischievous, they call him, "vicious."&mdash;At
five, with <i>Ben</i>. I rode out for exercise&mdash;After a while we arrived
at <i>George-Lee's</i>&mdash;He gave us some excellent Peaches&mdash;He returned
with us to Mr Turberville's&mdash;We met here with Miss <i>Betsy Lee</i>,
Mr <i>Grubb</i>, <i>Lancelot Lee</i> &amp; here we spent the evening&mdash;<i>Fish-Feasts</i>,
&amp; <i>Fillies</i>, Loud disputes concerning the Excellence of each others
Colts&mdash;Concerning their Fathers, Mothers (for so they call the
Dams) Brothers, Sisters, Uncles, Aunts, Nephews, Nieces, &amp; Cousins
to the fourth Degree!&mdash;All the Evening Toddy constantly circulating&mdash;Supper
came in, &amp; at Supper I had a full, broad, sattisfying View
of Miss <i>Sally Panton</i>&mdash;I wanted to hear her converse, but poor Girl
any thing She attempted to say was drowned in the more polite &amp;
useful Jargon about Dogs &amp; Horses!&mdash;For my Part, as I was unwilling
to be singular, if I attempted to push in a word, I was seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
heard, &amp; never regarded, &amp; yet they were constantly refering their
Cases to me, as to a supposed honest fellow, I suppose because I wear
a black Coat, &amp; am generally silent; at Home I am thought to be
noisy enough; here I am thought to be silent &amp; circumspect as a <i>Spy</i>&mdash;How
different the Manners of the People! I try to be as cheerful
as I can. &amp; yet I am blamed for being stupid as a Nun&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 26.</i></p>

<p>Mr Christian came while we were at Breakfast&mdash;Soon after came
Miss <i>Washington</i>, Miss <i>Hale</i> &amp; the Miss <i>Lee's</i>&mdash;I kept myself in my
Room pretty Close&mdash;Towards evening Mrs <i>Carter</i>, Miss <i>Washington</i>,
Miss <i>Hale</i>, Mrs <i>Christien</i> &amp; <i>Myself</i> had a thorough ramble, first
thro' the Garden&mdash;We gathered some Figs, the Ladies seem fond
of them, I cannot endure them&mdash;Then we stroll'd down the Pasture
quite to the River, admiring the Pleasantness of the evening, &amp; the
delightsome Prospect of the River, Hills, Huts on the Summits, low
Bottoms, Trees of various Kinds, and Sizes, Cattle &amp; Sheep feeding
some near us, &amp; others at a great distance on the green sides of the
Hills, People, some fishing, others working, &amp; others in the Pasture
among the Horses;&mdash;The Country emphatically in her goodly
Variety! I love to walk on these high Hills where I can see the Tops
of tall Trees lower than my Feet, at not half a miles Distance&mdash;Where
I can have a long View of many Miles &amp; see on the Summits
of the Hills Clusters of Savin Trees, through these often a little
Farm-House, or Quarter for Negroes; these airy Situations seem to
me to be the Habitations of Health, and Vigor&mdash;We return'd, &amp; all
were apparently well satisfied with the walk&mdash;Evening was spent
jovially in Dancing, at Supper, I left the Company, being not very
well, &amp; retired to my Chamber, Thanks to my heavenly Father, that
I can enjoy a competent Measure of Health when many are sick
around&mdash;A Note from Mr Lowe. Miss <i>Betsy Lee</i>, &amp; her Brother
came in just at night&mdash;Miss <i>Lee</i> seems cheerful, dances well, sings
agreeably, appears free of formality, &amp; Haughtiness the Common
foible here,&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 27.</i></p>

<p>The morning spent in setting coppies, Sums &amp;c., for the School&mdash;After
Breakfast, I spent a couple of Hours in the Dancing-Room&mdash;Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<i>Lee</i> in our Room raved against the Scotch&mdash;He swore that if his
Sister should marry a Scotchman, he would never speak with her
again; &amp; that if he ever Shall have a Daughter, if She marries a Scotchman
he shoots her dead at once!&mdash;At twelve I rode to Mr Washingtons,
the Country extremely pleasant Dined with the <i>Parson</i>, his
<i>Brother</i>, Mrs <i>Smith</i>, Miss Pettit, Mr Blain, Mr Buckner,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> &amp; several
of Mr <i>Lowes</i> Boys; Mr Lowe was from home. On my return I found
no company, except <i>Grubb</i> who had come in my absence. We spent
the Evening after sipping our Coffee in Chat with Mr &amp; Mrs Carter.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 28.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Grubb</i> rose very early, having yesterday made every previous
necessary preparation, &amp; set out for Home about One hundred miles
Distance. He has so much good Nature, is always so cheerful, &amp; at
the same time void of any thing malicious, clamorous &amp; impudent,
that I cannot but esteem &amp; very much respect him&mdash;On some whimsical
unsubstantial Miff or other, however, our Girls cannot endure
him&mdash;he wrote them some Copies the other Day, &amp; tho' he writes a
much finer neater hand than I they would not allow it, nor hardly&mdash;Strive
to imitate&mdash;I laughed at the ridiculous, the perfect Picture of
Female <i>Caprice</i>, &amp; <i>Obstinacy</i> in Miniature&mdash;Sermon is to Day at
Ucomico, so that I keep my Room&mdash;I wrote several Letters which
are to be forwarded by Mr <i>Blain</i>, one to <i>Jack Peck</i>, one to <i>John

begun also a Sermon I understand by Mrs <i>Carter</i> &amp; <i>Ben</i> who were at
Church, that the <i>Parson</i> was unable to read Prayrs or Preach, having
a Fever, but that there was a thronged Assembly; many I am told,
have the Ague &amp; Fever, but none are dangerous or have it fixed&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a Letter of yours lying before me, in which you say "that
if I had continued writing to you, it is more than probable you had
been as negligent as ever; but that my leaving off for a Time has at
last extorted a Letter from you"&mdash;Mighty pretty! I dare say the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Sentiment is genuine, &amp; you may be assured that I allow &amp; believe it.</p>

<p>You are not, therefore, to account this any thing more than the
Ghost, the Shade of a Letter; for, thinking this an extraordinary
Case, I have gone beyond my usual Manner of speaking, in Order to
convince you of my Resolution&mdash;And <i>swore</i> that I will not interrupt
you til' I have received several.</p>

<p>If you receive this by the Conveyance I expect (I send it by Col:
<i>Lee</i> who attends the Congress) it will be a few Days before I leave
Virginia; for I intend, by the Permission of Heaven, being at Home
by the beginning of November at farthest.</p>

<p>In the mean Time, since I ardently wish your constant and perpetual
Felicity, from a deep-rooted Friendship, which I have discovered
in a thousand Variations, suffer me to borrow a Form of Mr
Addison, &amp; put up one important Prayr in your Behalf "Ye guardian
Angels to whose Care heaven has intrusted its dear Laura, guide her
still forward in the Paths of Virtue, defend her from the Insolence &amp;
wrongs of this undiscerning World; At length, when we must no
more converse with such Purity on Earth, lead her gently hence,
innocent &amp; unreproveable to a better Place, where by an easy Transition
from what She now is, She may shine forth an Angel of Light."</p>

<p>It would be bold &amp; presumptuous, or I would with Earnestness &amp;
Sincerity extend the Wish a little farther, but transfer it to Fortune,
&amp; pray that She would make you mine. I ought, however, to be
cautious here&mdash;In so nice a Case, Truth &amp; Virtue are often thought
impertinent.</p>

<p>I advise you, upon the whole, to consult &amp; examine the Prospect you
have of substantial Happiness, when you are about to change your
State for Life. Inform yourself, so far as you are able, of the <i>Quality</i>
&amp; <i>Measure</i> of what you think your chief Happiness&mdash;Your Satisfaction
&amp; Comfort will consist in.</p>

<p>Place this against necessary Distress &amp; Perplexity; You will thereby
have a clearer &amp; fuller View of both; Your Judgement will be less
confused; &amp; more likely to fix to Advantage;&mdash;You are to consider
that a wrong Choice brings on a Train of Curses; but view it in the
other Light, &amp; it is almost a State of unmixed Pleasures&mdash;</p>

<p>
I am, Madam yours

<p><i>Monday 29.</i></p>

<p>Miss <i>Fanny</i> in School to Day, but not entirely well of her Sores made
by the <i>Ticks</i>&mdash;<i>Ben</i> complains of a pain in his breast; he seems to have
many symptoms of Weakness in his breast&mdash;I attempted to take a
rough Draught of the Great House for myself&mdash;Evening after Coffee
the C[o]lonel entertained us by playing on the Harmonica.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 30.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Carter</i> rides to Westmoreland Court. By him I send my Letters
to Mr <i>Blain</i>, who is going to the Congress&mdash;<i>Ben</i> seems to be no better;
has a slight Fever, pain in his Breast, &amp; Uneasiness, I fear he is
bordering on a Consumption&mdash;His fond Mother discovers great
Anxiety, &amp; true affection. Once I too had a fond indulgent Mother;
when I was sick, or otherwise distress'd, She was always impatient til
my Health &amp; Ease returned; &amp; She used to urge me likewise by precept
&amp; example to strive for an habitual Preparation for Sickness and
Death! But oh! She has gone &amp; left me, &amp; Friendship seems to have
been buried with her!&mdash;Formality &amp; Pretence are common enough,
but Sincerity &amp; affection are exceeding rare&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i> thinks it
better for <i>Ben</i> to sleep at the Great-House til he grows better, for
the advantage of giving him medicine&mdash;I seem now when it is late
in the Evening, lonely, &amp; a little fearful, at least I think on what I
made a Subject for a merry Hour, when I was at Home last, &amp; a
young Lady was complaining of being fearful at Night, &amp; afraid to
sleep in a Room alone&mdash;There are now (asleep I suppose) in this
House, below Stairs Mr <i>Randolph</i>, &amp; Mr <i>Burney</i> the Cooper; two
clever lusty youngsters, &amp; in the Room next to mine <i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Harry</i>
sleep&mdash;I feel yet gloomy; <i>Ben</i> is missing, &amp; which is worse, he is
sick&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 31.</i></p>

<p>Last Fryday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Teusday, &amp; this Day have
been perfectly fair, but yesterday &amp; to Day are very hot&mdash;<i>Ben</i> quits
reading &amp; is quite unwell&mdash;Dined with us Mr <i>Wadman</i>: He is, I
believe, a Man of a good understanding, but desperate in his religious
Principles&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span><i>Thursday Septemr: 1st: 1774.</i></p>

<p>One other <i>Calm</i>, <i>sunny</i>, <i>sweltering</i> day</p>

<p>The Colonel says it is the hottest Day we have had&mdash;I keep myself
caged up in my Room, &amp; cannot venture out on my usual <i>walk</i> or
Ride for exercise&mdash;Through divine goodness I continue in perfect
Health, but as skinny &amp; meagre as tho' I was continually sick&mdash;<i>Ben</i>
seems a little more pert today&mdash;Evening it Lightens in the North
West.</p>


<p><i>Fryday 2.</i></p>

<p>Extreme hot to day&mdash;Yesterday a Negro Child about six years old
sickened as to appearance with the Ague &amp; Fever, &amp; to Day about
eleven in the morning it expired! It is remarkable that the Mother has
now lost seven successively, none of which have arrived to be ten
years old!&mdash;The Negroes all seem much alarm'd, &amp; our School make
it a Subject for continual Speculation; They seem all to be free of
any terror at the Prescence of Death; <i>Harry</i> in special signified a Wish
that his turn may be next. I should be glad if his desire were wise; &amp;
he was as fit for the business of the other world, as he seems willing
to leave the business of this&mdash;In the evening this unexpected Death
was the Subject of Conversation in the House&mdash;Mr <i>Carter</i> observed,
that he thought it the most desirable to die of a Short Illness. If he
could have his Wish he would not lie longer than two days; be taken
with a Fever, which should have such an unusual effect on his Body
as to convince him that it would be fatal, and gradually increase till
it affected a Dissolution&mdash;He told us that his affairs are in Such a
state that he should be able to dictate a Will which might be written
in five Minutes, &amp; contain the disposal of his estate agreeable to his
mind&mdash;He mentioned to us the Substance&mdash;"That he would leave
Mrs <i>Carter</i> 6000 Serling; &amp; leave the remainder of his Estate to be
disposed among his children as the Law directs."&mdash;</p>

<p>He told us likewise, with great firmness, that if he hives [lives]
to see his children grown, he will pay no regard to age, but give his
wealth to Him who bids fairest to be useful to mankind&mdash;That he
allows all an equal oppertunity of improvement, but the One who is
found then improved shall with the Learning inherit also the Substance&mdash;<i>Dennis</i>
the Lad who waits at Table, I took into the School<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to day at his Fathers request, He can spell words of one syllable
pretty readily. He is to come as he finds oppertunity.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 3.</i></p>

<p>Indeed says Mrs Carter at Breakfast, the Lightning, Rain, &amp; Thunder,
disturbed me, &amp; kept me padding from Room to Room all Night; I
first had the Girls Beds removed as far as possible from the Chimneys&mdash;then
had lights placed in the passage; and then but without <i>rest</i> or
<i>pleasure</i>, I wandered through the house silent &amp; lonely like a disturbed
Ghost!&mdash;It has however effected an agreeable change in the
Air; which is now cool &amp; agreeable. I was invited this morning by
Captain <i>Fibbs</i> [Gibbs] to a <i>Barbecue</i>: this differs but little from the
Fish Feasts, instead of Fish the Dinner is roasted <i>Pig</i>, with the proper
apendages, but the Diversion &amp; exercise are the very same at both&mdash;I
declined going and pleaded in ex[c]use unusual &amp; unexpected Business
for the School&mdash;By appointment is to be fought this Day near
Mr <i>Lanes</i> two fist Battles between four young Fellows. The Cause of
the battles I have not yet known; I suppose either that they are
lovers, &amp; one has in Jest or reality some way supplanted the other;
or has in a merry hour call'd him a <i>Lubber</i>, or a <i>thick-Skull</i>, or a
<i>Buckskin</i>, or a <i>Scotchman</i>, or perhaps one has mislaid the others hat,
or knocked a peach out of his Hand, or offered him a dram without
wiping the mouth of the Bottle; all these, &amp; ten thousand more quite
as triffling &amp; ridiculous, are thought &amp; accepted as just Causes of
immediate Quarrels, in which every diabolical Stratagem for Mastery
is allowed &amp; practised, of Bruising, Kicking, Scratching, Pinching,
Biting, Butting, Tripping, Throtling, Gouging, Cursing, Dismembring,
Howling, &amp;c. This spectacle, (so loathsome &amp; horrible!) generally
is attended with a crowd of People! In my opinion, (others
may think for themselves) animals which seek after &amp; relish such
odious and filthy amusements are not of the human species, they are
destitute of the remotest pretension to humanity; I know not how
they came by their form, by the help of which they are permitted to
associate with Men, unless it has been (unfortunate for the World!)
by an intermixture of the meaner kind of Devils with prostitute
Monkeys!&mdash;This however, I cannot determine; But I think all such
should be deemed by the community infectious, &amp; suspended at least
any kind of intercourse, til, either the lineage be settled &amp; recorded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
or those shrew'd Characteristicks of a spurious, illegitimate claim to
kindred with men be in a good Measure abated.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 4.</i></p>

<p>We had last night a flood of rain, the wind North East stormy&mdash;No
Church to Day&mdash;Mr Carter sent down to his Mill-Dam, &amp; channel
all his people to try if they can secure them; he gives them Rum, &amp; a
Shilling a man&mdash;</p>

<p>I read Prayrs, by the desire of the Parents, at the Grave over the
deceased Child <i>Priscilla</i>, <i>Nanccy</i>, <i>Fanny</i>, <i>Betsy</i>, <i>Ben</i>, <i>Bob</i>, <i>Harry</i>, &amp;
Myself, &amp; about forty or fifty Negroes were present. Neither the
Father nor the Mother of the Child went out; imitating the example
they see in others, &amp; stay from an affectation of overflowing Grief.</p>


<p><i>Monday 5.</i></p>

<p>There is wonderful <i>To do</i>, this morning among the Housekeeper &amp;
children, at the great house. They assert that a Man or a Spirit came
into the Nursery about one o-Clock this morning&mdash;That if it was
indeed a Spirit the Cause of his appearance is wholly unknown; but if
it was Flesh &amp; blood they are pretty confident that the design was
either to rob the House, or commit fornication with <i>Sukey</i>, (a
plump, sleek, likely Negro Girl about sixteen)&mdash;That the doors &amp;
windows were well secured, but that by some secret manner, unknown
to all, the <i>Thing</i> opened the Cellar door, went through the
Cellar, &amp; up the narrow dark Stairs (which are used only on necessary
occasions, as when the great Stair way is washing or on some
such account)&mdash;That it left the said Cellar door standing open, &amp;
besides unbar'd, &amp; threw open the East Window in the little Room,
in order, as they wisely supposed, to have, if it should be hurried, a
ready passage out&mdash;That it had previously put a small wedge in the
Lock of the Nursery Door, where several of the young Ladies, &amp;
the said <i>Sukey</i> sleep, so that when they were going to Bed they
could not Lock nor bolt the door, but this they all believed was
done in mischief by the children, &amp; went thereupon to bed, without
suspicion of harm, with the door open&mdash;That Sukey some time
in the Night discovered Something lying by her Side which she
knew to be a Man by his having Breeches&mdash;That She was greatly
surprised, &amp; cry'd out suddenly to the others that a Man was among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
them, &amp; that the Man <i>tickled</i> her, &amp; said <i>whish, whish</i>&mdash;That on this
She left the Bed &amp; run &amp; squeased herself in by the side of Miss Sally
the House-keeper, but that by this time the Whole Room was awake
&amp; alarmed&mdash;That when the thing knew there was a discovery it
stamped several times on the floor, shook the Bedstead by the side
of which it lay, rattled the Door several Times &amp; went down Stairs
walking very heavy for one barefoot&mdash;That on its leaving the Room
the Hous[e]Keeper went to Ben Carters Chamber, &amp; that he rose &amp;
they all went down &amp; found the Doors &amp; window as I have mentioned&mdash;All
this with many other material accidents is circulating
through the family to Day; some conclude it was a Ghost because
it would not speak&mdash;But, more probably it was one of the warm-blooded,
well fed young Negroes, trying for the company of buxom
<i>Sukey</i>&mdash;The Colonel however, at Breakfast gave out that if any one
be caught in the House, after the family are at Rest, on any Pretence
what ever, that Person he will cause to be hanged!&mdash;This
Afternoon <i>Nelson</i> the Lad who waits in our School, was in the woods
about half a mile off, where he met with &amp; kill'd a <i>Rattle-Snake</i> having
six Rattles&mdash;He cut off the head, &amp; brought Home the remainder
of the Body, which we have skin'd &amp; stuff'd&mdash;Mrs Carter complains
to Day of the Tooth-Ach, &amp; a slight Fever.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 6.</i></p>

<p>The day fine&mdash;It is whispered to Day that B... is the Ghost that
walk'd in the Nursery the other night, but I think the report is false,
and arises from calumny. We had an expectation of company to day,
but are disappointed. We dined on Fish &amp; Crabs, which were provided
for our company, to-morrow being Fish-Day&mdash;I begun a Sermon
Job XXIII. 3. 4. We have too vagrant Tinkers with us mending
several articles, one of whom is this afternoon violent sick with the
Fever &amp; Ague&mdash;I rode to my old spot, the Corn field, by chance
met with Mr Taylor. I walked with him among the Tobacco Cotton
&amp;c. He gave me Directions for raising the latter.&mdash;Cotton must be
planted about the middle of May in rich Land, prepared with Hills,
&amp; made very mellow. When up it must be weeded &amp; kept clean, it
must be top'd &amp; suckered as Tobacco, otherwise it runs too much to
vine. Towards the Fall it will begin to open, when the opened pods
mu[s]t be gathered &amp; laid by til dry, then the Cotton pick'd out &amp;
clean'd&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span><i>Wednesday 7.</i></p>

<p>Mrs Carter not very well; is troubled with a small tooth-Ach Fever
&amp; a Cold&mdash;Every leisure minute I spend in writing at my Sermon&mdash;Dined
with us Mr Sorrel, &amp; Mr .... on Fish, Rock, Perch, fine <i>Crabs</i>,
&amp; a large fresh <i>Mackerel</i>. Yesterday &amp; to day I have been a little
pained &amp; pretty much alarmed, at an unusual feeling in my right
arm. Almost all the Summer I have felt an obstruction when I would
lift up my arm. But now it is a trembling steady <i>knawing</i> down the
under part of my arm &amp; Wrist, without unless when I move it suddenly&mdash;Evening
I walked throug the pasture to the River, the Hills
are green, since the late rains, &amp; look fine tip'd with the setting Sun.</p>


<p><i>Thursday 8.</i></p>

<p>Cloudy &amp; cool. I rise now by half after six&mdash;I found it necessary to
flogg <i>Bob</i> &amp; <i>Harry</i> on account of lying in bed, after I come into
School&mdash;At twelve Mr &amp; Mrs <i>Carter</i>, with all the Family except
<i>Ben</i>, Harry &amp; Myself; Ben staid of choice, &amp; Harry I kept at Home
on account of a sullen Impudence when I dismiss'd them&mdash;I told
them that they both had my leave to go but at the same time it was
my advice that they should stay&mdash;Harry then answered "D&mdash;n my
Soul but i'll go!" At this I informed him that he had at once dismiss'd
himself from my authority. &amp; without singular signs of Submission
I should never take him under my direction more&mdash;And
therefore that he had general &amp; unbounded Liberty to go not only
to the Horse Race, but <i>where</i> &amp; <i>when</i> he chose&mdash;He seem'd startled,
&amp; began to moderate his answer: I ordered him out of the Room, &amp;
told him to use his liberty. Mrs <i>Carter</i> took with her all the young
Ladies &amp; all her children&mdash;<i>Ben</i> &amp; I with great satisfaction dined alone.
Nelson, to Day, kill'd another Rattle Snake; near the place where he
kill'd the other, which had twelve Rattles&mdash;Harry grew sick and refused
to go to the Race, he came soon to my room &amp; with every
Sign of Sorrow for his conduct begg'd me to forgive him, at first I
refused, but at length I took him in, yet informed him that I shall
pass over no other instance of what may be called rudeness only.&mdash;The
Colonel on his return, in the evening informed us that the Race
was curious, &amp; that the Horses were almost an even match&mdash;That
the Betts were Drawn &amp; no Money paid&mdash;That the Rider of one of
the Horses weighed only forty Seven pound&mdash;Strange that so little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
substance in a human Creature can have strength &amp; skill sufficient to
manage a Horse in a Match of Importance&mdash;Something alarming
happened a few nights ago in the Neighbourhood at Mr <i>Sorrels</i><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
a House in sight&mdash;It is supposed that his Negres had appointed to
murder him, several were found in his bed chamber in the middle of
the night&mdash;his Wife waked&mdash;She heard a whispering, one perswading
the other to go&mdash;On this She waked her Husband, who run to
his Gun; but they escaped in the dark&mdash;Presumption is so strong together
with a small confession of the Fellows, that three are now in
Prison&mdash;The ill Treatment which this unhappy part of mankind receives
here, would almost justify them in any desperate attempt for
gaining that <i>Civility</i>, &amp; <i>Plenty</i> which tho' denied them, is here, commonly
bestowed on Horses!&mdash;Now, Laura, I sleep in fear too,
though my Doors &amp; Windows are all secured!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 9.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Stadley</i> came in before Breakfast. He inform'd us that Governor
<i>Dunmore</i> has gone to the Frontiers with about 400 Men to subdue
the Indians&mdash;That the Indians seem disheartened, &amp; leave their
towns, &amp; are unwilling to fight&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i>, out of Compliment,
this morning presented to <i>Ben</i> &amp; <i>I</i> for staying at home yesterday, a
large fine <i>Cake</i>&mdash;Dined with us a Stranger&mdash;<i>Ben</i> with great Humour
either out of a <i>Bravado</i> or for Revenge gave out in the Family to day
that it is the opinion of a certain <i>Female</i>, of considerable Note in
the family, that all the male Children which shall be born in this unlucky
year, tho' they may be fair to the Sight, will be yet unable,
from a Debility of Constitution, to do their Duty, with respect to
Women, either married or single&mdash;That She has two reasons for this
opinion,</p>

<p>1. Because the Air appears to her extremely <i>barren</i>, <i>weak</i>, &amp; <i>ungenerative</i>&mdash;2.
Because the Peaches, &amp; other Fruit, are observed this year
to have in them very few Kernels, at the same time that the Peaches
are sweet &amp; fair&mdash;I think that <i>Ben</i>, by this stratagem, whether it be
real or otherwise, is levil with the invidious Vixen which suspected
him of entering the Nursery to visit black-faced Sukey&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 10.</i></p>

<p>With the Boys I Surveyed a small field lying along the Richmond
Road; the Colonel has a good <i>Theodolite</i> &amp; other Aparatus for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Surveying&mdash;English Magazines, &amp; Reviews arrived to Day&mdash;One of the
Books lately published I am desirous to purchase viz.&mdash;Dr <i>Henry's</i>
History of Great Britain on a new Plan. This history is to be contained
in ten Books, each of which will be divided into seven chapters.
In the first Chapter of every Book, the Author relates, the civil
&amp; military History of Great Britain&mdash;The second chapter contains
the ecclesiastical History of the same period: the third presents us
with the history of our political constitution, Government, Laws, &amp;
Courts of justice: the fourth is employed upon what relates to Learning
&amp; Learned men: the fifth investigates the State of the useful &amp;
ornamental Arts: the sixth enquires into that of commerce, Shipping,
Money, with the prices of commodities: &amp; the last Chapter of
every Volume is alloted to a Detail of the Manners, Virtues, Vices,
remarkable Customs, Language, Dress, Diet, &amp; Diversions of the
Great Britains&mdash;Six o-Clock, Mrs <i>Turberville</i>, Miss <i>Jenny Corbin</i>,
and Miss <i>Turberville</i> came in; Miss <i>Corbin</i> has been, all the Summer,

evening, in Mr Randalls<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Room, a Young man about twenty years
old, totally deaf, &amp; dumb! He is well-set, lusty, &amp; likely; he is cheerful,
good natur'd, extremely dextrous, quick of apprehension, &amp;, in
short, very conversable, &amp; sociable by signs&mdash;he was taken to the
much famed Dr <i>Graham</i>,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> when he was in this Colony trumpeting
about his own unproved Abilities; he fumbled with the unfortunate
Lad, by blooding, gouging, boreing &amp;c. putting him to torture and
expence without any possible expectation of help&mdash;He Sustains
among his neighbours the Reputation of being, <i>honest</i>, <i>industrious</i>,
&amp; <i>useful</i>&mdash;He supports by Labour his mother, &amp; himself; He is remarkably
fond of Cloths; &amp; vastly curious, &amp; nice in examining every
article of dress, where he has the smallest intimacy&mdash;He abstains entirely
from strong Liquor.&mdash;And what most of all produced admiration
in me, was his taking a Pen &amp; writing his Name "<i>Coley Reed</i>"
in a good legible Hand, better indeed, than the Bulk of planters are
able to do! But he can write nothing more&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ben</i> rode out yesterday after Dinner and returned this morning; but
came on foot, I begin to suspect him of being actually engaged in
what several alledge against him&mdash;But I will keep off so long as I
possibly can, so unwelcome, so unwelcome &amp; so Base a thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

when he leaves the Family; his entire <i>good-Nature</i>, <i>Cheerfulness</i>,
<i>Simplicity</i>, &amp; <i>Skill</i> in Music have fixed him firm in my esteem&mdash;None
go to Ucomico Church to day&mdash;Towards evening, I took a
book in my hand, &amp; strolled down the Pasture quite to the Bank of
the River&mdash;Miss <i>Stanhope</i>, <i>Priss</i>, <i>Nancy</i>, <i>Fanny</i> &amp; <i>Betsy Carter</i> were
just passing by&mdash;They walked to the <i>Mill</i>; there they entered a
Boat, &amp; for exercise &amp; amusement were rowed down the River quite
to the granary, &amp; then went to angling&mdash;I walked to them, &amp; together
we all marched Home to <i>Coffee</i>.</p>

the Ship lying at <i>Leeds</i>, arrived this afternoon our new Coach&mdash;It
is a plain carriage, upper part black, lower Sage or Pea-Green&mdash;The
Harness is neat strong, &amp; suitable for the Country. Price 120
Sterling&mdash;In the same Ship Mrs <i>Carter</i> imports about 30 value
in plate in a pair of fashionable Goblets; Pair of beautiful Sauce-Cups;
&amp; a Pair of elegant Decanter-holders&mdash;<i>Ben</i> introduced into
our Room a plain useful Book-Case, in which we class &amp; place our
Books in order. after School, I took a Book, and walked through the
Pasture strolling among Horses, Cows, &amp; Sheep, grazing on the Hills
&amp; by the River.</p>

<p>We thought of Fire this morning, but put it off&mdash;Ben's mare is not
yet heard of, though he has had a Boy almost constantly searching
about for her&mdash;It is curious to see the Girls imitating what they see
in the great House; sometimes tying a String to a Chair &amp; then run
buzzing back to imitate the Girls spinning; then getting Rags &amp;
washing them without water&mdash;Very often they are knitting with
Straws, small round stockings, Garters &amp;c&mdash;Sometimes they get sticks
&amp; splinter one end of them f[o]r <i>Brushes</i>, or as they call them here
<i>Clamps</i>, &amp; spitting on part of the floor, they scrubb away with great
vigor&mdash;&amp; often at a small game with Peach-stones which they call

for his Mill 7000 Bushels of Wheat at 4s 6d pr Bushel.&mdash;I am at a
Loss to know where he will dispose of such vast Quantities!&mdash;The
Colonel who is often pidling in some curious experiment, is to day
making some Printers Ink&mdash;He tells me the Materials are Lint-seed-Oil,
Wheat-Bread, Onions, &amp; Turpentine, a rank compound truely&mdash;then
for Black, Lamp-Black, red, Vermillion&mdash;<i>Ben</i>, found his mare
lost in last Saturday's Visit, poor Brute! She was confin'd in the Pasture
where he left her, in which being very large She had been concealed.&mdash;Mr
<i>Smith</i>, who was wounded last Spring by a Shot of his
Brother is lately dead, &amp; it is said by the Wounds which he received
from his Brother!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 15.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben</i> is much better: he has return'd to his Bed in my Room, but complains
often of the pain in his Breast.&mdash;I put him to begin &amp; read
some select odes in Horace&mdash;He works arithmetic but is only in Reduction&mdash;He
dispises Greek, &amp; therefore makes little or no progress
in that Language&mdash;He is reading in course the Eneid Lib 3&mdash;He has
an unconquerable Love for Horses; he often tells me that he should
have been a skilfull, &amp; useful Groom; that he should be more fond
&amp; careful of a favourite Horse than of a <i>Wife</i>, or than his <i>victuals</i>, or
than any thing whatever! I never saw a Person, in any Diversion,
Recreation or amusement, who seemed so full of Pleasure &amp; enjoyment
as he is when on Horse back, or even in the company of a
Horse! He seems to possess as warm a regard for them as Dr <i>Swift</i>
had for the Houyhnhnms&mdash;But I cannot discover that Ben has so
cordial an enmity to Mankind as <i>Swift</i> had for the Yahoos.&mdash;<i>Bobs</i>
passion for the same Animal is no less strong, but it is furious, &amp;
cruel, he rides excessive hard, &amp; would ride always&mdash;<i>Harry's</i> Genius
seems towards Cocks, &amp; low Betts, much in company with the waiting
Boys, &amp;, against my strongest Remonstrances, &amp; frequent severe
corrections, he will curse, at times, horribly, &amp; swear fearfully! he always,
however, omits it when I am Present.&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 16.</i></p>

<p>Mrs <i>Carter</i>, this morning, with <i>Prissy</i>, <i>Nancy</i>, &amp; <i>Bob</i> went in the
New-Coach to the <i>Dance</i> at Stratford, the morning is mild, fair <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>&amp;
cool&mdash;The Colonel informed me that now his Mill-House Bake-Houses,
Store Houses &amp;c. with a clear unobstructed navigation is
compleated, &amp; that, he will rent them all to a Person properly qualified&mdash;or
gladly employ a person who is capable, trusty &amp; industrious
enough to be the sole Director of so great &amp; valuable Property&mdash;Dined
with us captain <i>Walker</i>&mdash;He threw out several exceeding
unpopular Sentiments with regard to the present amazing Disturbances
through the Colonies&mdash;One in special I think proper to record
because it fixes his Character, &amp; declares him, in Spite of all pretence,
an enemy to America&mdash;He asserted that no Officers (at Boston or
elsewhere) are obliged, either by Law, or Right, to question or refuse
any kind of orders which they receive from their Sovereign,
or commanding Officer&mdash;But I account every man, who possesses,
&amp; publishes such sentiments in this Crisis of the Fate of a vast Empire,
as great an enemy to America at least, as Milton's <i>Arch-Devil</i> was to
Mankind!&mdash;After School, we took the Theodolite, the Colonel along,
&amp; run several Lines, He seems perfectly well acquainted with the
Art.</p>


<p><i>Saturday 17.</i></p>

<p>At eight I dismiss'd my small charge. Immediately after Breakfast
I took some Boys, &amp; went a Surveying; <i>Ben</i>, impatient of tiresome
scurvy Home, strain'd off through the County&mdash;I run in to Dinner,
the Colonel &amp; I dined alone, we drank a Glass of Madeira, as a Health
to absent Friends, after which I went again to the Field &amp; survey'd
till six in the evening; The Business of this Day has been to go round
the inner Pasture About half an Hour after Sunset (when Women
who love their Husbands &amp; Families always come Home) Mrs Carter
&amp; the Girls arrived from Stratford She informed us that there was a
large, genteel, and agreeable Company at the Dance; that the Ague &amp;
Fever have been &amp; continue troublesome in that Neighbourhood; &amp;
that Word is arrived from Boston that Governor Gage has fired on the
Town, &amp; that it is expected his orders are to burn &amp; beat it to Destruction!
<i>Ben</i> returned about seven from Westmoreland Courthouse&mdash;He
informed us that Mr <i>Sorrels</i> Negroes had their trial there to Day, concerning
their accusation of entering their Masters House in the night
with an intention to murder Him&mdash;It was there proved (so far as
Negroes evidence will go) that a Brother of this Sorrels early last
Spring bribed some Negroes to Poison his Brother; &amp; when that diabolical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Attempt could not succeed, he has since tried to perswade
them to murder Him!&mdash;But all Evidence against the Negroes was so
weak &amp; dark that the judges ordered them to be whiped &amp; dismised
them&mdash;Though the Law considers all Testimony given by a Negro
against a White-Man as weak &amp; unsubstantial; yet what the Negro
said to Day on Oath of the younger Mr Sorrel, seems to gain much
Belief with many who are candid, &amp; unbiased Judges; &amp; with me beyond
all Scruple, it fixes on him the cursed Character of a <i>Fratricide</i>!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 18.</i></p>

<p>The Colonel gave me, at Breakfast the offer of a Seat in his Boat to
Church. The Morning was fine, &amp; Nomini-River alive with Boats
Canoes &amp;c. some going to Church, some fishing, &amp; some Sporting&mdash;Mr
<i>Smith</i> gave us a very practical Sermon against the common vices
here, in particular against the practise of abusing Slaves&mdash;The report
concerning Boston is much talked off &amp; still confirmed!&mdash;We dined
all at Mr Turberville's; Miss <i>Corbin</i> looks <i>fresh</i> &amp; <i>plump</i> as ever. Towards
evening arose a pretty furious Thunder-Gust, which we
hardly escaped on our way home I observed that several, but in
special Mr <i>Carter</i> is not pleased with Mr Smith's Sentiments of
Slavery.</p>


<p><i>Monday 19.</i></p>

<p>The morning fine &amp; cool, &amp; produces in our School at last a fine
Fire!&mdash;Fire looks &amp; feels most welcome; and I observe it makes our
children remarkably garrulous &amp; noisy&mdash;I took cold by Saturdays unusual
exercise, &amp; to Day have a Pain through my head, sore throat,
&amp; the other common troubles in a Cold&mdash;This Day begins the examination
of The Junior class at Nassau-Hall. Every time I reflect on
that Place of retirement &amp; Study, where I spent two years which I
call the most pleasant as well as the most important Period in my past
life&mdash;Always when I think upon the <i>Studies</i>, the <i>Discipline</i>, the <i>Companions</i>,
the <i>Neighbourhood</i>, the <i>exercises</i>, &amp; <i>Diversions</i>, it gives me
a secret &amp; real Pleasure, even the Foibles which often prevail there
are pleasant on recollection; such as giving each other <i>names</i> &amp;
<i>characters</i>; Meeting &amp; Shoving in the dark entries; knocking at
Doors &amp; going off without entering; Strowing the entries in the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with greasy Feathers; freezing the Bell; Ringing it at late Hours of
the Night;&mdash;I may add that it does not seem disagreeable to think
over the Mischiefs often practised by wanton Boys&mdash;Such are writing
witty pointed anonymous Papers, in <i>Songs</i>, <i>Confessions</i>, <i>Wills</i>,
<i>Soliliques</i>, <i>Proclamations</i>, <i>Advertisements</i> &amp;c&mdash;Picking from the
neighbourhood now &amp; then a plump fat Hen or Turkey for the
private entertainment of the Club "instituted for inventing &amp; practising
several new kinds of mischief in a secret polite Manner"&mdash;Parading
bad Women&mdash;Burning Curse-John&mdash;Darting Sun-Beams
upon the Town-People Reconoitering Houses in the Town, &amp; ogling
Women with the Telescope&mdash;Making Squibs, &amp; other frightful compositions
with Gun-Powder, &amp; lighting them in the Rooms of timorous
Boys, &amp; new <i>comers</i>&mdash;The various methods used in naturalizing
Strangers, of incivility in the Dining-Room to make them bold; writing
them sharp &amp; threatning Letters to make them smart; leading
them at first with long Lessons to make them industrious&mdash;And trying
them by Jeers &amp; Repartee in order to make them choose their
Companions &amp;c. &amp;c&mdash;Evening after School with Mrs Carter, &amp; the
Girls I took a Walk thro the Pumpkin &amp; Potatoe Vines. the Air is
clear, cold &amp; healthful. We drank our Coffee at the great House very
sociably, round a fine Fire, the House And air feels like winter again.</p>


<p><i>Teusday 20.</i></p>

<p>Among the many womanish Fribbles which our little Misses daily
practise, I discovered one to Day no less merry than natural; <i>Fanny</i>
&amp; <i>Harriot</i> by stuffing rags &amp; other Lumber under their Gowns just
below their Apron-Strings, were prodigiously charmed at their resemblanc
to Pregnant Women! They blushed, however, pretty
deeply on discovering that I saw them&mdash;We have to day both in the
School &amp; great-house steady Fires&mdash;Mr <i>Thomas Edwards</i> a reputable
Planter in the Neighbourhood died this day about one o-Clock&mdash;I
saw him last Sunday at Church when he was in good Health; was
taken the same Evening, &amp; hurried off at once!&mdash;Frail Man, how
easily subdued!&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 21.</i></p>

<p>We have a more particular account of the Death of Mr <i>Edwards</i>.
About a twelve-month ago, he was suddenly siezed with a Fit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Palsy, his Foot, Side, Arm, &amp; part of his Face then failed, &amp; became
useless, after some time, however, he grew better, &amp; has since been apparently
well; til Sunday evening last after the Shower, as he was
walking in his Garden, he fell down in an instant, there happened to
be help at hand, he only said these emphatical Words&mdash;"<i>Now I
must die</i>"&mdash;He was carried in, &amp; expired as I mentioned yesterday!&mdash;I
am told that the Flux is in the upper part of this County&mdash;My
cold continues; in the Evening on going to bed, I took a dose of
Honey &amp; Rum&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Thursday 22.</i></p>

<p>A pure cold northerly wind still blows, &amp; we all keep Fires&mdash;Peaches
&amp; Fruit are omitted at Dinners, &amp; Soup or Broth is brought in; Milk
and Hominy at Breakfast too are laid by &amp; Coffee &amp; Sage Tea brought
in; Our Suppers are Coffee &amp; Bred &amp; butter&mdash;<i>Neatness</i> <i>variety</i> &amp;
<i>Plenty</i> are reigning Characters in our worthy oconomist Mrs Carter.
I read to Day, &amp; am charm'd with a &mdash;&mdash; of Lord Chesterfield. Letters
to his natural Son, which I propose to purchase&mdash;After School, with
Ben, I took a walk to Mr Turberville's&mdash;He has received a line from
Colonel Lee at Philadelphia that the Congress is going on&mdash;That the
account concerning Boston is false&mdash;Evening Lancelot Lee came in,
&amp; staid the night&mdash;He gave Ben &amp; myself an Invitation to dine with
him tomorrow, I took out of the Library &amp; began to read Watts's
Logic&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 23.</i></p>

<p>I spent some time in reviewing Geography &amp; Logic&mdash;Mr Lee left
us about twelve, &amp; Ben rode out with him&mdash;Evening from Mr Turberville's
I saw some <i>Barberry's</i>, <i>Sloes</i>, &amp; <i>Pomegranates</i>, neither of
which I had seen before&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 24.</i></p>

<p>Together with my Cold I have to Day a most disagreeable gathering
on my middle Finger&mdash;I keep myself at home reading Logic&mdash;Evening
the Colonel invited me to walk with him; he took me to his
Mill, <i>Coopers</i>, <i>House</i>, <i>Channel</i>, <i>Meadows</i> &amp;c., and was vastly particular
in describing to me their particular uses&mdash;I begin to look with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
eager Sollicitude to the time of my revisiting my friends &amp; Relations&mdash;It
is, happily near&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Sunday 25.</i></p>

<p>The morning clear cool &amp; very dry&mdash;I rode to Ucomico-Church, I was
surprised when the Psalm begun, to hear a large Collection of voices
singing at the same time, from a Gallery, entirely contrary to what
I have seen befor in the Colony, for it is seldom in the fullest Congregation's,
that more sing than the Clerk, &amp; about two others!&mdash;I am
told that a singing Master of good abilities has been among this
society lately &amp; put them on the respectable Method which they, at
present pursue&mdash;I dined at <i>Mr Fishers</i>, among others I saw there, Dr
<i>Steptoe</i>, &amp; Mr <i>Hamilton</i> who have lately been to Philadelphia&mdash;They
give various Reports concerning political affairs, &amp; as to the
Congress nothing certain, so that I say nothing on that Score&mdash;Their
Remarks on the City &amp; Inhabitants; The Country &amp;c. are curious&mdash;They
allow the City to be fine, neat, &amp; large; they complain a
little of the small Rooms, Uniformity of the Buildings, &amp; several other
like faults&mdash;They call the Inhabitants grave &amp; reserved; &amp; the
Women remarkably homely, hard favour'd &amp; sour!&mdash;One Colonel
Harrison<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> from a lower County in this Colony, offer'd to give a
Guinea for every handsome Face that could be found in the City, if
any one would put a Copper on every Face that did not come up to
that Character!&mdash;This is an impeachment of the Ladies which I have
never heard before, I do not give my opinion either for or against it&mdash;The
face of the Country, &amp; the method of farming that way delights
them: but at this I dont wonder.</p>


<p><i>Monday 26.</i></p>

<p>Yesterday the Inspector, whom I have named &amp; described before, desired
the Parson to wait on them in his family and christen his Child&mdash;Is
the child sick? No Sir&mdash;Why then today? it is the Mothers Desire
Sir&mdash;Why was it not brought to Church? The Mother is unwell,
Sir&mdash;The Parson excused himself, &amp; promised to come some
Days hence, but the long winded officer, inured to Stubbornness,
hung on, &amp;, without moderation or Apology <i>demanded</i> his presence!&mdash;And
prevail'd.&mdash;Something in our palace this Evening, very merry
happened&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i> made a dish of Tea. At Coffee, she sent me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
dish&mdash;&amp; the Colonel both ignorant&mdash;He smelt, sipt&mdash;look'd&mdash;At last
with great gravity he asks what's this?&mdash;Do you ask Sir&mdash;Poh!&mdash;And
out he throws it splash a sacrifice to Vulcan&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Teusday 27.</i></p>

<p>This morning the Colonel with his Theodolite observed the Centre of
the Sun at his rising, &amp; found it bore East 5 South&mdash;This he is doing
to fix a true East &amp; West Line for regulating the Needle at any
time. This Bearing he corrected by finding the Suns Declination, &amp;
fixed his Points&mdash;After the morning we let our fire go down&mdash;Both
yesterday, &amp; this evening I rode out to exercise myself &amp; horse
against our approaching Journey&mdash;Mr <i>Hodge</i>, a Merchant of <i>Leeds</i>
&amp; Mr <i>Leech</i> a Merchant of Dumfries came Home with the Colonel
from Westmoreland-Court&mdash;Both chatty, in special Mr Leech; both
well-bred, sensible, &amp; sociable&mdash;The loyal Toast was <i>Wisdom</i> &amp;

to be toasted, I gave Miss <i>Jenny Washington</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p>You will please to acquaint Mr Rigmaiden<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> that I received and
looked over his Note, and should have attempted to answer it but
for the following reasons. I observe that the first author of the question
very rudely calls Mr Rigmaiden a fool for not working it by
Cross-Multiplication.</p>

<p>And I observe too that Mr Rigmaiden throws back the word fool,
(I suppose in revenge) upon the other, and if I should intermeddle
in the case it is more than probable, that I should be called the third
fool, by either the one or the other, at least I think the hazard of this
too great to set against any Honour I could recieve by resolving it&mdash;But
since Mr <i>Rigmaiden</i> intimates in his note that he is at something
of a loss to know whether himself or the other have the
least claim to the character; I shall propose a question in arithmetick,
which will fully decide any dispute of this nature, for I pronounce
the man who can work it off at once, to be no fool in figures.</p>

<p>A Man has 5000 which he puts to interest for 30 years 6 per
Cent. per Annum. I demand how much of this he must spend every
day, to spend it all, principal and interest in the thirty years, and let
the daily sums in the whole time be equal?</p>

<p>As to the question given, "to Multiply 12 12s 12&frac12;d by itself",
It must have been a punn, or from one not well skill'd in figures. If
it was the former, it does not deserve to be answered at all, because
that would be indulging wanton impertinence; and if it was the latter,
I am not able to understand how such a person should venture
to question Mr <i>Rigmaidens</i> answer&mdash;Upon the whole, I am apt to
think it is all a punn which, "Brother Quill" (as he is pleased to style
himself) has ventured to throw out, and on this account, until I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
better satisfied that the sentiment is genuine, I decline wholly entering
farther into the matter.</p>

<p>You will comprehend, at once, the design of Horace in the Ode
from which this motto was taken, And, perhaps, you may think the
application of it here unmeaning, and impertinent. In order to free
you wholly from every such secret suspicion, you will please to
take notice, that the dignity of your very respectable family, (which
is a sacred thing) depends almost entirely upon your <i>Capacity</i>, <i>improvement</i>,
and <i>behaviour</i>, an attempt, therefore, to guide and enlarge
either or all of these may not be called unmeaning; and, as
you have honoured me for some time past in the character of a Tutor,
by submitting to my advice and instruction, I cannot suppose
you so utterly destitute of candour and gratitude as to put the name
of impertinence on what is the <i>close</i> and <i>sum</i> of my duty to you:
especially as there is but little probability that I shall ever see you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
more, and can, therefore, have no possible incitement from interest,
to flatter nor oppertunity of indulging any kind of revenge. These
remarks, I presume, are sufficient to remove from you any hurtfull
prejudice. I therefore go on, to make several observations with
moderation and freedom, which, at least, I hope you will duely consider,
and if they please you, practise. Give me leave then, first of all
to tell you, That you possess a critical tho' a high station, and that in
your road throug[h] life you are liable to innumerable dangerous
[dev]iations. On many accounts your station is critical; I shall enumerate
only a few.</p>

I informed the Colonel that it is hardly probable I shall continue
in his family til his return from the general Court, &amp; at the

eight &amp; nine o-Clock&mdash;It is wonderful to consider the Consumption
of provisions in this family&mdash;I have before spoken of Meat, &amp; the

I enquired if he would undertake the education of several children in
this Colony: he seem'd willing, but would make no promise, nor enter
into any agreement til he is fully instructed as to the number and
standing of his pupils, the conditions of the agreement, and time
when he is to begin.</p>

<p>I expect to return shortly to Philadelphia, and write these to acquaint
you that I would willingly forward a letter to him, if you are
yet desirous of employing him to instruct your family.</p>

<p>you will please, Madam, if you think proper to write, to direct
the letter thus "To Mr Samuel Leek junr: Cohansie, New Jersey&mdash;"</p>

<p>I shall leave this place about the 18th instant.</p>

Breakfast took <i>Prissy</i>, <i>Fanny</i> &amp; Harriot, &amp; made Mrs Washington a
Visit, <i>Ben</i>, <i>Harry</i>, Betsy &amp; I are left at Home alone I spent to Day
in writing off Mr Peck's Letter&mdash;Evening I am troubled with a
drunken Carpenter; he saw a Light in my Chamber&mdash;up he bouzes,
with a Bottle of Rum in his hand; Who keeps Home?&mdash;I asked him
in&mdash;Have you any water Sir?&mdash;Not any I told him&mdash;Not a Drop,
Sir?&mdash;No&mdash;My Flute was lying on the Table, he took it for a Trumpet
&amp; tooted in for two or three Minutes Then again he begs, O Sir
call in a Servant &amp; have me some Water&mdash;But I left the Room glad
to be free of his foolish Impertinence. At Supper Mrs Carter informed
us that Captain <i>Walker's</i> little Son has the putrid Quinsey,
but we hope it is only a bad sore Throat by a Cold&mdash;I have a Complaint
of a painful Jaw, for these several Days</p>

<p>Expence to the Smith for mending my Stirrup a Pisterene 1/3&mdash;Ben
this morning Wrote a letter to his Papa&mdash;I finished off mine for Mr

Miss Letty.</p>

<p><i>Ben</i> &amp; <i>Harry</i> ride to Ucomico Church I at home spend the day in
my Room, I walked out towards evening &amp; saw a number of Negroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
very busy at framing together a small House&mdash;Sundays they commonly
spend in fishing making Potatoes &amp;c., building &amp; patching their
Quarters or rather Cabins&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Monday 10.</i></p>

<p>The General Court at Williamsburg begins to sit this Day&mdash;We
have no intelligence of the carryings on of the Congress; our Papers
this Summer come vastly seldom, it is said that the Post Men are
bribed &amp; give away the News Papers. I expect that Mr Peck is about
setting out from Home for this place&mdash;I wish him a speedy &amp; successful
passage, for I am now impatient of Delay til I visit again my
acquaintances &amp; Home&mdash;The day is cold, the wind at North &amp; the
ground extremely dry&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 11.</i></p>

<p>Mr <i>Stadley</i> came this morning. He brings no news of the Congress,
but much of the great Race lately at Fredericksburg&mdash;Every Evening,
for the Benefit of exercise I ride out, and commonly carry with
me one of the small Girls, who partaking of the prevailing Spirit, are
passionately fond of Riding&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Wednesday 12.</i></p>

<p>I was told often before I left Home that coming into Virginia would
bring me into the midst of many dangerous Temptations: Gay Company,
frequent entertainments, little practical devotion, no remote
pretention to Heart religion, daily examples in Men of the highest
quality, of Luxury, intemperance, &amp; impiety: these were urged, by
my kind acquaintances, as very strong dissuasions against my leaving
home; the admonitions I accepted with great Thankfulness, tho' I
could not allow them to turn me off from my purpose &amp; I resolved
with as much sincerity &amp; Firmness as I could to carry them with me
in every part of my behaviour. The close of the time of my Stay
here is I expect now near at hand: And if I may judge myself of the
carrying my resolutions into practice, I should pronounce that I have
not been wanting in my duty in this respect. Some few who frequently
ask me to go from home, say I am dull, unsociable, &amp; splenetic:
But the Gentlemen generally here have a good &amp; reasonable manner
of judging in this case they are well pleased with strict &amp; rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
virtue in those who have the management of their children, if it does
not grow to factious enthusiasm; so that Levity, tho perhaps they
would wink at it lessens, &amp; in a while would take away the Reputation
&amp; business of a Family Tutor&mdash;Of this I was fully convinced in
a short time after my coming into the Colony, &amp; saw too the very
great advantage of the Precaution which I received from my friends,
for they assisted me in setting out on a safe, and prudent Plan, which
has, I hope directed me to propriety of conduct with regard to my
private character, &amp; likewise to my little lovely Charge.</p>

<p>Good Mr Stadley left us this morning. I took leave with great reluctance
of this worthy Man, &amp; do not expect to see him more!&mdash;After
Breakfast Mrs Carter with the young Ladies, rode to Colonel Tayloe's.
My jaw continues growling &amp; keeps me uneasy, I very much
fear some hurtful humours are collecting themselves there together&mdash;To
day at twelve o-Clock <i>Bob</i> providentially escaped with his life&mdash;He
went up into a tall Chesnut tree to cut down Boughs &amp; gather
Chesnuts &amp; foolishly he began to cut the Limb on which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
standing, at a little distance from his feet&mdash;Chesnut splits extremely
easy, so that when the Limb was about half cut off it split down;
this so weaked the part on which Bob stood that his weight instantly
split it too, &amp; down he must have tumbled upwards of thirty feet but
he happily caught a bough on his way down.&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Fryday 14.</i></p>

<p>The Disorder in my face continues, slow, uniform, &amp; Steady; it does
not hinder me from rest by night or from any exercise or business by
day; But It keeps me in continual doubt, &amp; anxiety, whether it be
not something gathering which will be peculiarly distressful&mdash;But
my temper, I fear, in these respects is very phlegmatic; I find it unpleasing
to myself, &amp; it would be certainly unpleasant to any one
who was interested in my complaints&mdash;I am of so strange a constitution
that very trifles make me utterly unhappy&mdash;A mere conceit,
frivolous &amp; unsubstantial often takes away my rest&mdash;This feeling I
have possest from my infancy; I remember very well that a Cuff on
my Ear would make me sullen for Several days when I was too young
to go out to school; Afterwards a disappointment of an hours play
would mak me disrelish for a long time both play-fellows, &amp; all Diversion!
When I was at the College one Blunder at recitation, or in
any performance of my duty would make one [me] dull, low-Spiritted,
&amp; peevish; In fact any disappointment, even the most inconsiderable
seems to have a general Effect on my Passions &amp; mingle
fear, &amp; anger, &amp; rage, together with many others which are excited
by different &amp; disagreeable modifications of our Bodies, &amp;, tho' I am
conscious of this frailty in myself, I have not yet brought myself
under so good subjection, as to make these humours give way intirely
to Philosophy or Religion&mdash;It is, however, my constant study
how I may accomplish this much wish'd for habit&mdash;While we are
dining there is a large shower of rain but by no means plentiful, for
the earth is uncommonly dry&mdash;Mrs <i>Carter</i> to day asked me if Mr
Peck is to be here before my setting out: I answered that he is&mdash;And
says she, is he grave as you?&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Saturday 15.</i></p>

<p>I rode after Breakfast to Dr Thompsons with a settled purpose of
having my troublesom tooth drawn out but on examination he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
it to be too far back, &amp; too short to be extracted&mdash;More sorry I.&mdash;Dined
with us besides the family, Mr <i>Munro</i>, young Mr Washington,
and Master Christien&mdash;Here is a fine Prospect from an exceeding
high eminence, of the Potowmack; River Nominy; our House, which
is six miles distant; Lee Hall Bush-field; all remote.&mdash;Evening I rode
Home, the country pleasant Bought several articles as presents for
the young Ladies, a neat gilt paper Snuff Box for Miss Priscilla, a
neat best clear Hair-Comb a piece for Miss Nancy &amp; Fanny. A broad
elegant Sash a piece for Miss Betsy &amp; Harriot Value of all 15s. Soon
after my return, when I was in the Chamber adjusting my articles
Ben came bawling at my window Mr Peck's come, Mr Peck's come!
I step'd to the window, &amp; saw presently that what he said was fact,
my Heart bounc'd &amp; I with it bolted down to meet him But he comes
empty of a letter, &amp; barren of news, at least all he brings seems
gloomy; none at all of the great Congress; very little of the present
momentious political affairs; that it has been at Cohansie an unhealthy
season; that good &amp; useful Mr Hunter has been ill of a disorder in his
head: that Mrs Reve is gone &amp; left a Brood of infants! that young
<i>Tom Jennifer</i> of Port-Tobacco, my acquaintance at College too is
dead! that matters go in their usual course at Cohansie &amp; Princeton;
that <i>Laura</i> is not in new Jersey! All his intelligence is similar to this,
which is to me harsh &amp; unharmonious as a Ravens ominous Croak!&mdash;To
Day Harry boil'd up a Compound of Poke-Berries, Vinegar,
Sugar &amp;c. to make a red Ink or Liquid&mdash;I spent the evening til two in
the morning in conversation.</p>


<p><i>Sunday 16.</i></p>

<p>A fine morning&mdash;We rose by Seven but we were informed that there
is no Sermon so that out of compliment to Mr Peck's weariness we
kept close at home rathar than ride to Richmond. We spent the Day
in our chamber til towards evening when with the young Ladies we
took a turn down the River Many we saw fishing&mdash;Mrs Carter with
<i>Priss</i> rode to Captain Turberville's&mdash;We all return'd and assembled
by evening at the great House&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Monday 17.</i></p>

<p>Before Breakfast I heard all the School a lesson round Mr Peck
Present&mdash;After Breakfast I heard their Tables, Grammer &amp;c. &amp; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in Spite of my resolution with great reluctance, I resigned up to Mr
Peck my little much-loved Charge!&mdash;The pain in my Face is quite
gone&mdash;To day I saw a Phenomenon, Mrs Carter without Stays!&mdash;She
complains of a pain in her breast, that prevents her wearing
them, she says that She is always supposing the worst, &amp; fears it is a
Cancer breeding there&mdash;I hope it may be only fear&mdash;I am more &amp;
more every day pleased with the manner, Temper, Oconomy, &amp;
whole management of this good Lady&mdash;Now I am to take my final
Leave!&mdash;Towards evening we all went down on the River &amp; had a
pleasant exercise&mdash;</p>


<p><i>Teusday 18.</i></p>

<p>Early to Day I wrote a Note to Mr Lowe and Harry Fantleroy to
dine with us to day, &amp; soon received their promise&mdash;After Dinner
with Mr Lowe on the violin, I play'd over many tunes on the Flute,
he plays with good Taste and accuracy&mdash;At five we all walk'd over
to Mr Turberville's&mdash;I gave to our Wash-Woman some old Linen
&amp; as a Box 2/4&mdash;We spent the evening in Music Chat &amp; pleasantry&mdash;But
this said thing which I hear of that turn-Coat <i>Laura</i>, that She
loves &amp; courts one Mr <i>Rodman</i> this distresses me exceedingly But
this relieves me, for I have had it always in my View that&mdash;Varium
&amp; mutabile semper Feminae&mdash;Tho I have made a Solemn vow which
I have no inclination at all to forego, yet if it shall appear that she
has listened to another, my dearest vow is not inviolable; I will retreat
from every former Promise, I will not hearken to womanish solicitations,
but I shall in return for her want of goodness treat her with
contempt; &amp; Sincerely pity, instead of resent, her ineffectual
Caprice&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;The Widow left the Room after begging that I would stay to

Piece of Drawing.&mdash;I viewed it, She saw me, &amp; began a fine Apology&mdash;That
her Situation is so lonely, being out of the Way of Entertainment

necessary Amusements&mdash;That She was glad of the Opportunity of an

said She, I want very much to up to Philada:&mdash;I heard all this with

Watts's Logic&mdash;Yes, Madam, I have some Acquaintance with him&mdash;And

Miss Beatty both had disapproved of your Conduct, &amp; had by themselves,

us of the Conversation &amp; Behaivour of the great Socrates the morning
he was to die. "When his Fetters were knocked off, being seated in
the midst of his Scholars, and laying one of his Legs over the other
in a very unconcerned Posture, he began to rub it where it had been
galled by the Iron: And willing to improve every Oppertunity of
instructing them he observed the Pleasure of that Sensation which
now arose in those very Parts of his Leg that just before had been so
much pained by the Fetter. Upon this he reflected on the Nature of
Pleasure &amp; Pain in General that they constantly succeed each other"&mdash;If

<p>&mdash;"From a Settlement made May 12: 1774 there appears a Balance
due from Laura of N. n to Lucius, fifteen Letters &amp; a Visit; the
whole to be paid on or before the 20th: of Novem. next ensuing&mdash;Which
Payment if not well &amp; truely made by the said Laura, within
the Time above limited, then the said Lucius is, &amp; by these Presents
shall be now &amp; forever possest of the full Liberty of siezing, destraining,
or taking any or every Part of the said Delinquents Goods &amp;
Chattels, &amp; disposing of the same, as he shall think proper til the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
said Balance be made up&mdash;And in Case there shall be failure of
Effects, then it is &amp; Shall be lawful for the said Lucius to take under
his immediate Direction the Person of the said Laura&mdash;</p>

<p>This 1. Day of Decem: on which I am examining a little into my
Accompts is the 11:Day since the Time of Payment allow'd to that
young Lady is fully expired&mdash;"Curse not the King, said Solomon, in
thy Bed-Chamber, not even in thy Heart"&mdash;Why? "The Birds of the

Pounds, Shillings, &amp; Pence&mdash;Very fine, young black Coat&mdash;Don't be
too fast, Madam, I've got a Gown on, &amp; my Hair is cu'd&mdash;On the 4:
of July 1774. about three in the Afternoon, I was sitting alone in
my Chamber, in Virginia, thinking&mdash;Among many other Conclusions
I remember well, it was determined in my mind that this same
Laura who is now so much in my Debt, is actually worth 50,000
Sterling, pr Annum&mdash;Where is the Impropriety then, of my mentioning
Solomon's Advice?&mdash;Does it now hurt your Conscience,
Madam?&mdash;</p>

<p>If you can have Patience, I will tell you, from my Virginia Journal
the true Cause of that Conclusion.</p>


<p class="signature">
&mdash;Monday. July 4th: 1774.<br />
</p>

<p>"Miss Nancy Carter, at Dinner, informed us that Miss Lee, a
young Lady from Richmond is now at Mr Turberville's, &amp; she begg'd
that her Brother, &amp; I would go in the Evening &amp; invite her here&mdash;We
consented, &amp; after School took Horses &amp; rode on our Errand; Besides
Miss Lee, we found Capt: Turberville, his Lady, Daughter, &amp;
several young Gentlemen.</p>

<p>After the Ceremony of Introduction, &amp; our Devoirs were over, we
took Seats, in a Cool Hall where the Company were sitting;&mdash;All
when we entered were smiling at young Mr &mdash;&mdash; who had been gathering
Mulberries, &amp; stained his Ruffle&mdash;The Attention of the Company
being wholly taken up with him, I had the Oppertunity which
I wanted, of examining the Person of his Sister, without being interrupted
either by the Notice of others, or by my own Timidity.
Miss Lee, I am told, is now entering her 20th Year; She is handsome.
Her Eyes are exactly such as <i>Homer</i>, attributes to the Goddess
<i>Minrva</i>; and her Arms resemble those which the same Poet allows
to <i>Juno</i>&mdash;Her Hair is a dark leaden Colour; &amp; was craped &amp; knotted
up very high, &amp; in it neatly-woven, a Ribband, with a Sprig of green
Jessamine&mdash;She wore a light Chintz Gown, very fine, with a blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Stamp, eligantly, &amp; fashionably made, &amp; which set well upon her&mdash;In
one word, her Dress was neat &amp; genteel; her Behaivour such as I
should expect to find in a Lady whose Education had been conducted
with Care &amp; Skill, &amp; her Person, abstracted from the Embellishments
of Dress &amp; Good-Breeding, not much above the Generality of
Women.</p>

<p>What made me desirous to see, and curious to examine this young
Lady, was a Sentence that was dropt yesterday by a respectable
Person in our Family, intimating a Desire that I may, on seeing Miss
Lee, after having known, by Report, her faultless Character, be so
far pleased with her Person, as to try to make her mine, &amp; settle in
this Colony&mdash;That kind Person who is for making me happy by
setling me in Virginia, &amp; connecting me with one of the best Families
in the Government little knows how painful it would be, if I
was indeed compell'd by any Accident of Fortune, to spend the Remainder
of my Days in Virginia, if it is the Pleasure of Providence,
that I am to continue for any Length of Time in the World.</p>

<p>"<i>Strong</i>, &amp; <i>sweet</i> are the Bands which tye us to our Place of
Nativity; If it be but a beggarly Cottage, we seem not satisfied with
the most rich &amp; splendid Entertainment if we are separated totally
from it.</p>

<p>"But if a Princess should ask me to accept together with herself,
50,000,  Sterling pr Annum; I declare with as great Pleasure as Truth
that the Esteem and Fidelity which I possess for my ever-dear Eliza
would make me, without Reflection, evade &amp; refuse the Offer."</p>

<p>This is not strained Panegyrick; it is still the faintest Image of my
Heart, tho' the Sentiment may seem strong &amp; improbable.</p>

<p>It gave me high satisfaction when I saw your brother first in our
province. I was cordially glad.&mdash;He came unexpected, and that circumstance
increased my pleasure at seeing him at all. He is now in
this city&mdash;Has been in several parts of East and West Jersey&mdash;Has
tolerable health&mdash;And a steady cheerfulness, which I am willing to
believe, arises from pretty constant entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>I hear with much surprise, that none of my letters, since I left
your family, have been so fortunate as to arrive safe. I impute this to
the jealousy of the public, concerning the contents of letters passing
through the continen[t].</p>

<p>Mr Peck carries you, with these, my best wishes&mdash;That you may
rise rapidly in the early improvement of your mind in each useful
and ornamental undertaking to which you may be directed&mdash;That
you may have much real unmixed happiness in the friendships which
your age and rank will soon lead you to form&mdash;And that the transporting
scenes which at a distance, you discover to be painted on
your future life, may, as they rise before you one after another, give
you as much peaceful enjoyment as so great imperfection can bestow.</p>

<p>You will please to give my best duty to your dear Mama.</p>

<p>I shall write to Miss Nancy. Do not fail by any means whatever,
to mention me to Miss <i>Fanny</i>, <i>Betsy</i>, and <i>Harriot</i>&mdash;Dear Harriot,
Dear Betsy, dear Fanny&mdash;Lovely, lovely Girls! And Tasker too, if
he has not forgot me, O tell him,&mdash;Tell them all how much I want
to see them&mdash;Tell them I will surely come for such impatience as
mine cannot bear disappointment.</p>

<p>You will also please to give my kind respects to Miss Sally Stanhope,
and to all the family without one exception.</p>

<p>May I ask you to send me a line? My desire of se[e]ing as well
as hearing from you is so strong I will venture&mdash;O write; three lines,
if you send no more, will put you to some little trouble, but none
can tell how welcome three lines from you would be to</p>

and the Guitar agree yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Pray do you ride out often? If you do, who rides with you; or do
you boldly ride alone?&mdash;Tell me who is yet mistress at Checks&mdash;I believe,
if you will allow me to guess at so great a distance, it is Fanny.
My dear Nancy I want much to see you. I would give this moment
my hand full of half-Bits, or their value in coppers, if I thought you

</p>

<p>I was much gratified at your indulgent permission of your Son to
visit, for a time, these northern Provinces. I think it will on the whole,
be several ways advantageous to him. When I first saw him, he was
feeble, and daily feverish; now he is better&mdash;He attended the commencement
at Princeton; has been some time in Philadelphia&mdash;Seems
cheerful&mdash;I think entertained&mdash;And will not return home without
having made some useful observations&mdash;I am however fearful, that
his constitution is not sufficiently vigorous, without scrupulous attention
to exercise and nourishment, to afford him lasting health.</p>

<p>With regard to the public concerns they are here at so high a pass,
and so complex, I must refer you to <i>Ben</i> and Mr <i>Peck</i>.</p>

<p>I hear with great anxiety of Mrs Carters Illness; but hope, through
the kindness of auspicious Heaven, that before you receive these, She
will again enjoy her usual health. You will please to remind her of
my constant strong esteem; it flows from the remembrance of a succession
of unmerited kindness.</p>

<p>I have wrote frequently since I left your family, but am surprized
to hear that all my letters have been intercepted or lost.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, with great truth &amp; Esteem</p>

To Miss <i>Priscilla Carter</i>.<br />

Presented as a Valentine.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When <i>Custom</i> calls I must away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She calls me now, &amp; chides my Stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She asks my usual annual care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To compliment some worthy Fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hasten to <i>Apollo's</i> Shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Aid to form a <i>Valentine</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But if <i>Apollo</i> I invoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gay <i>Fancy</i> I shall sure provoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who swears these yearly Rhimes should be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Order, Sense, &amp; Learning free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if each line be fill'd with Stuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twill please a Lady well enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Fancy only can inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Youthful Heart with frantic Fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To write such inconsistent Lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As always please in Valentines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if Apollo lends his Aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I address a well-bred Maid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Verses plain yet fill'd with sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Girl would curse my Impudence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pedantic, earth-born Fellow! he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hobbling Tutor write to me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him go teach his Scholars Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or learn, himself, to dance, to speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn to please, or never dare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb the Quiet of the Fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke; but why should I obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What unsubstantial Phantoms say?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet <i>Fancy</i> urg'd her case so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No human Mind could guess or tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hidden Scheme she had in View,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor what the <i>Baggage</i> meant to do:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till <i>Pallas</i> Queen of wisdom came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told the mischief of the Dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Fancy, Madam, early knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twas my Desire to write to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She therefore whisper'd in my Ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you would nought but Nonsense hear<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In hopes to baffle my Design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or form a vulgar Valentine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Pallas told me what to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I design'd to write to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make <i>Humour</i>, Truth, &amp; Sense conspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With genuine poetic-Fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To form a Song in Taste &amp; Ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such would your Infant-Bosom please.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, Miss, accept in humble Lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My weak attempt to sing your Praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor think it rudeness when I try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold your virtues up on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shew their bright yet living Blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make inraptured Numbers gaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Slander</i> herself must disappear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or justify my Conduct here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since <i>Fancy</i>, <i>Wit</i>, &amp; <i>Pallas</i>, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all contending, Miss, for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I in the common sportful Way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pleasure now of you might say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That both your Eyes are glowing Darts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which only seen do wound our hearts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Venus' Son by her command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waits always at your fair Right-Hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the <i>Loves</i> in Beauty drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are always hov'ring near your Breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, tho Such words appli'd to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every sense should all be true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you hear such pleasant Rhimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sung in your Ear ten thousand Times:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet always doubt what makes you more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ever <i>Mortal</i> was before.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When any Girl; with beauty drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Innocence above the Rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' <i>Fortune</i> has withheld her Store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the blushing Maiden poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Ladie's look with envious Eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well-born Men the <i>Angel</i> prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or when the God of Wealth is kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who does not <i>worth</i> nor <i>Beauty</i> mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives some sordid <i>Woman</i> Gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our foolish Sex is bought &amp; sold;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We cringe, &amp; court, &amp; sigh, &amp; whine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swear the Nymph is quite divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sometimes, tho' Examples here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeding seldom do appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a good Girl of solid sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who does not make the least pretence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what our Fancies rate so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great estate &amp; sparkling Eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows tis only want of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes her incapable to please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore Studies hard to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plant such Virtues in her Mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As shall the place of Friends supply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With constant mirthful Company:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes these Virtues far outdo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of <i>wealth</i> &amp; <i>Beauty</i> too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make a low-born Virgin rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seem a <i>Goddess</i> in our Eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But when we image in our Mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty, &amp; Wealth, &amp; Genius join'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see them all to one belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Colours are so bright so strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None can resist the powerful Blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all with <i>Love</i>, &amp; <i>Rapture</i> gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If Madam, my Presage be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may apply all these to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And free from <i>Fear</i>, or <i>Interest</i> say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on some happy Future Day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When years shall have the <i>worth</i> exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yet lies prison'd in your Breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And settled more the charming Grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grave <i>good Humour</i> in your Face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you have been by <i>Fortune</i> blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And born of <i>Fame</i>, &amp; <i>Wealth</i> possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those full-blown Charms the world will see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one common voice agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such perfection is design'd<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sure then I've cause with Heart sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bless the <i>Chance</i> which led me here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plac'd me down by <i>Wisdom's</i> Flow'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which still grows lovelier every Hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose tender Branches bud &amp; shoot<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And promise early useful Fruit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' <i>Chance</i> has given me in Care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Nurse this plant &amp; make it fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet generous <i>Nature</i> had before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been so unsparing of her Store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That unemploy'd, with wondering Eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only stand, &amp; see it rise!<br /></span>

pleasure-ground, or park of such
a nature as not to interrupt the view
from the mansion and may not be seen
until closely approached. According
to a French etymologist, the name is
derived from <i>ha</i>, an exclamation of
surprise, uttered by one suddenly approaching
such a boundary. The ha-ha
consists of a trench, the inner side
of which is perpendicular and faced
with a wall; the outer being sloped
and turfed. The ha-ha permitted grazing
cattle and sheep to appear on the
landscape, and at the same time held
them at a distance from the mansion.
In his diary, George Washington refers,
on several occasions, to the ha-has
on the grounds at "Mount Vernon."

had spread into the Piedmont
section prior to the American Revolution.
A paroled British officer writing
of his situation in Albemarle County
in 1779, said: "The house that we reside
in is situated upon an eminence,
commanding a prospect of near thirty
miles around it, and the face of the
country appears an immense forest,
interspersed with various plantations,
four or five miles distant from each
other; on these there is a dwelling-house
in the center, with kitchens,
smoke-house, and out-houses detached,
and from the various buildings, each
plantation has the appearance of a
small village; at some little distance
from the houses, are peach and apple
orchards, &amp;c. and scattered over the
plantations are the negroes huts and
tobacco-houses, which are large built
of wood, for the cure of that article."

hospitality of the country was such,
that travellers always stopt at a plantation
when they wanted to refresh
themselves and their horses, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
they always met with the most courteous
treatment, and were supplied
with every thing gratuitously; and if
any neighbouring planters heard of
any gentleman being at one of these
ordinaries, they would send a negroe
with an invitation to their own house."
Cf. Anburey, <i>Travels Through the
Interior Parts of America</i>, Vol. II, p.
198. This same traveller described the
hospitality shown the guests at one of
the James River plantations. "I spent
a few days at Colonel Randolph's, at
Tuckahoe, at whose house the usual
hospitality of the country prevailed,"
he wrote. "It is built on a rising
ground, having a most beautiful and
commanding prospect of James River;
on one side is Tuckahoe, which being
the Indian name of that creek, he
named his plantation Tuckahoe after
it; his house seems to be built solely
to answer the purposes of hospitality,
which being constructed in a different
manner than in most other countries;
I shall describe it to you: It is in the
form of an H, and has the appearance
of two houses, joined by a large saloon;
each wing has two stories, and
four large rooms on a floor; in one
the family reside, and the other is
reserved solely for visitors: the saloon
that unites them, is of a considerable
magnitude, and on each side are doors;
the ceiling is lofty, and to these they
principally retire in the Summer, being
but little incommoded by the sun, and
by the doors of each of the houses,
and those of the saloon being open,
there is a constant circulation of air;
they are furnished with four sophas,
two on each side, besides chairs, and
in the center there is generally a
chandelier; these saloons answer the
two purposes of a cool retreat from
the scorching and sultry heat of the
climate, and of an occasional ball-room.
The outhouses are detached at
some distance, that the house may be
open to the air on all sides." <i>Ibid.</i>,

his home at Cohansie, New Jersey, in
1770, at the age of twenty-three, to
enter the College of New Jersey at
Princeton. Nassau Hall was the principal
structure of the college, and the
institution was often familiarly referred
to by that name. Fithian was
graduated there in September 1772.
His parents had both died suddenly
during the previous February. Andrew
Hunter, Jr., of Cohansie, who wrote
this letter, was the nephew of the
Reverend Andrew Hunter, Sr., of
Greenwich, New Jersey, under whom
Philip was at this time studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>

a Scottish Presbyterian clergyman,
served as president of the College
of New Jersey at Princeton intermittently
from 1768 until his death in
1794. A staunch Calvinist, Witherspoon
exerted a strong influence on
American educational, religious, and
political development. Owing largely
to the labors of his former students, a
number of whom went as clergymen
and tutors to the Southern colonies,
his influence was very extensive in
that region.</p></div>

clergyman, thought to have been
a nephew of the Bishop of Durham,
was licensed to preach in Virginia in
1758. The following year he had
arrived in the colony and was serving
as the minister in Hanover Parish in
King George County. Possessing a
high tempered and somewhat contentious
nature, Giberne was involved
in numerous sharp controversies. An
exceptionally sociable and convivial
man, he spent much of his time in
visiting and gambling and tippling.
Admitted by his enemies at that time
to be the most popular and admired
preacher in the colony, he had been
invited shortly after his arrival in Virginia
to preach a sermon before the
Burgesses. This sermon was later
printed at their request. In 1760
Giberne married a wealthy widow,
Mary Fauntleroy Beale of Richmond
County, a daughter of Moore Fauntleroy
of "Crandall." She had previously
been the wife of Charles Beale. Removing
to her plantation, "Belle Ville,"
he was two years later chosen as
minister of Lunenburg Parish, and
served in that capacity until 1795. He
is mentioned in numerous diaries and
letters of the period. Cf. Goodwin,

of Bruton Parish Church at Williamsburg
from 1773 to 1818. He also served
for a period as master of the grammar
school at the College of William and
Mary, and for two years as president
of the college. At this time Bracken
had just incurred the bitter enmity of
Samuel Henley, professor of divinity
and moral philosophy at the college,
who had hoped to secure the appointment
given his rival. The two men
aired their grievances in a long and
acrimonious controversy carried on in
the columns of the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>.
Henley, a Tory, left the colony for
England in 1775 and never returned.
He later became principal of the East

in the possession of Carter's
descendants to the present time. The
original manor house was destroyed by
fire in 1850. A wooden structure
erected shortly after that time still
stands. Carter's daughter, Harriot
Lucy, married a well-known lawyer,
John James Maund. A daughter of
Harriot Lucy and John James Maund
became the wife of Dr. John Arnest.
"Nomini Hall" is today the residence
of Dr. Arnest's grandson, Mr. T. M.
Arnest, who is the great-great-grandson
of Councillor Robert Carter. The
only known representation of the original
manor house is a crude water-color
sketch done by an amateur artist
"E. Maund," a relative, who visited the
family and made the sketch shortly
before the house burned in 1850. One
obtains a clearer understanding of the
imposing character of this manor house
from Fithian's comments regarding it.
This is especially true of his observation
made when spending an evening
once at "Mount Airy," the "elegant
seat" of Colonel John Tayloe in Richmond
County. "The House," he said,
referring to "Mount Airy," "is about
the size of Mr. Carter's...."</p></div>

which flour was manufactured and

manufacture. In Virginia it was a common
practice for the owner of the mill
to pay for the wheat in flour. A mill
used exclusively for grinding grain
for local consumption was called a
grist or custom mill. A portion of the
grist was usually allowed the owner

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
